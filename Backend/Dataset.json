It has become one of the major\n topics of research since it finds its applications in autonomous driving,\n robotic navigation, 3D reconstruction, and many other fields. Finding pixel\n correspondences in non-textured, occluded and reflective areas is the major\n challenge in stereo matching. Recent developments have shown that semantic cues\n from image segmentation can be used to improve the results of stereo matching.\n Many deep neural network architectures have been proposed to leverage the\n advantages of semantic segmentation in stereo matching. This paper aims to give\n a comparison among the state of art networks both in terms of accuracy and in\n terms of speed which are of higher importance in real-time applications.",

Despite these concerns and risks, there are\n currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\n developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\n To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\n principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\n practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\n guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\n Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\n and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\n further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\n developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\n trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\n effectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\n image segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\n models trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\n and easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\n edges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\n region-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\n model training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\n of two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\n sightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\n statistical discrepancy of multiple decoders outputs is computed to denote the\n models uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\n mutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoders probability\n output and other decoders soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\n models uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\n and low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\n to learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\n results of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\n three public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\n semi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\n other existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\n medical image segmentation.",

To address the issue, we present a novel semi-supervised segmentation\n model based on parameter decoupling strategy to encourage consistent\n predictions from diverse views.

During the\n training process, we decouple the two prediction branch parameters by quadratic\n cosine distance to construct different views in latent space. Based on this,\n the feature extractor is constrained to encourage the consistency of\n probability maps generated by classifiers under diversified features.

        "Abstract": "Most recent semantic segmentation methods adopt a U-Net framework with an\n encoder-decoder architecture. It is still challenging for U-Net with a simple\n skip connection scheme to model the global multi-scale context: 1) Not each\n skip connection setting is effective due to the issue of incompatible feature\n sets of encoder and decoder stage, even some skip connection negatively\n influence the segmentation performance; 2) The original U-Net is worse than the\n one without any skip connection on some datasets. Based on our findings, we\n propose a new segmentation framework, named UCTransNet (with a proposed CTrans\n module in U-Net), from the channel perspective with attention mechanism.\n Specifically, the CTrans module is an alternate of the U-Net skip connections,\n which consists of a sub-module to conduct the multi-scale Channel Cross fusion\n with Transformer (named CCT) and a sub-module Channel-wise Cross-Attention\n (named CCA) to guide the fused multi-scale channel-wise information to\n effectively connect to the decoder features for eliminating the ambiguity.\n Hence, the proposed connection consisting of the CCT and CCA is able to replace\n the original skip connection to solve the semantic gaps for an accurate\n automatic medical image segmentation. The experimental results suggest that our\n UCTransNet produces more precise segmentation performance and achieves\n consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art for semantic segmentation\n across different datasets and conventional architectures involving transformer\n or U-shaped framework.

In\n this work, we propose to adapt contrastive learning to work with meta-label\n annotations, for improving the models performance in medical image\n segmentation even when no additional unlabeled data is available. Meta-labels\n such as the location of a 2D slice in a 3D MRI scan or the type of device used,\n often come for free during the acquisition process. We use the meta-labels for\n pre-training the image encoder as well as to regularize a semi-supervised\n training, in which a reduced set of annotated data is used for training.\n Finally, to fully exploit the weak annotations, a self-paced learning approach\n is used to help the learning and discriminate useful labels from noise. Results\n on three different medical image segmentation datasets show that our approach:\n i) highly boosts the performance of a model trained on a few scans, ii)\n outperforms previous contrastive and semi-supervised approaches, and iii)\n reaches close to the performance of a model trained on the full data.",

In addition, most existing semi-supervised\n approaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\n and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\n information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\n present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\n advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning.

Most common DA techniques require\n concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.\n However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source\n images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical\n imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from\n different clinical sites.

        "Abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to significant improvements in\n tasks involving semantic segmentation of images. CNNs are vulnerable in the\n area of biomedical image segmentation because of distributional gap between two\n source and target domains with different data modalities which leads to domain\n shift. Domain shift makes data annotations in new modalities necessary because\n models must be retrained from scratch. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is\n proposed to adapt a model to new modalities using solely unlabeled target\n domain data. Common UDA algorithms require access to data points in the source\n domain which may not be feasible in medical imaging due to privacy concerns. In\n this work, we develop an algorithm for UDA in a privacy-constrained setting,\n where the source domain data is inaccessible. Our idea is based on encoding the\n information from the source samples into a prototypical distribution that is\n used as an intermediate distribution for aligning the target domain\n distribution with the source domain distribution. We demonstrate the\n effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art medical\n image semantic segmentation approaches on two medical image semantic\n segmentation datasets.",

Inspired by human perception\n which parses a scene into perceptual groups, rather than analyzing each pixel\n individually, our proposed approach first partitions an input image into\n meaningful regions (also known as superpixels). Next, it utilizes\n Mutual-Information-Maximization followed by an adversarial training strategy to\n cluster these regions into semantically meaningful classes. To customize an\n adversarial training scheme for the problem, we incorporate adversarial pixel\n noise along with spatial perturbations to impose photometrical and geometrical\n invariance on the deep neural network. Our experiments demonstrate that our\n method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used\n unsupervised semantic segmentation datasets, COCO-Stuff, and Potsdam.",

        "Abstract": "Work in Counterfactual Explanations tends to focus on the principle of \"the\n closest possible world\" that identifies small changes leading to the desired\n outcome. In this paper we argue that while this approach might initially seem\n intuitively appealing it exhibits shortcomings not addressed in the current\n literature. First, a counterfactual example generated by the state-of-the-art\n systems is not necessarily representative of the underlying data distribution,\n and may therefore prescribe unachievable goals(e.g., an unsuccessful life\n insurance applicant with severe disability may be advised to do more sports).\n Secondly, the counterfactuals may not be based on a \"feasible path\" between the\n current state of the subject and the suggested one, making actionable recourse\n infeasible (e.g., low-skilled unsuccessful mortgage applicants may be told to\n double their salary, which may be hard without first increasing their skill\n level). These two shortcomings may render counterfactual explanations\n impractical and sometimes outright offensive. To address these two major flaws,\n first of all, we propose a new line of Counterfactual Explanations research\n aimed at providing actionable and feasible paths to transform a selected\n instance into one that meets a certain goal.

The most\n challenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated\n spatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods\n is to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various\n architectures (e.g., CNN\/GCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two\n disadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and\n therefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed\n into latent representations when passing through different architectures,\n making it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues,\n we propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST\n encoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with\n positional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies.\n Furthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled\n dot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the\n attention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies.

The classical quadrature rules\n used in the sigma-point filters are motivated via polynomial approximation of\n the integrand, however in the applied context these assumptions cannot always\n be justified. As a result, quadrature error can introduce bias into estimated\n moments, for which there is no compensatory mechanism in the classical\n sigma-point filters.

Our first contribution is to derive the well-known classical quadratures\n as special cases of the Bayes-Sard quadrature method.

The\n content image forms the structure, the basic geometric lines and shapes of the\n resulting image, while the style image sets the color and texture of the\n result. The word \"arbitrary\" in this context means the absence of any one\n pre-learned style.

Recent arbitrary style transfer algorithms make it\n possible to achieve good re-sults in this task, however, in processing portrait\n images of people, the result of such algorithms is either unacceptable due to\n excessive distortion of facial features, or weakly expressed, not bearing the\n characteristic features of a style image.

        "Abstract": "This paper establishes rates of universal approximation for the shallow\n neural tangent kernel (NTK): network weights are only allowed microscopic\n changes from random initialization, which entails that activations are mostly\n unchanged, and the network is nearly equivalent to its linearization.\n Concretely, the paper has two main contributions: a generic scheme to\n approximate functions with the NTK by sampling from transport mappings between\n the initial weights and their desired values, and the construction of transport\n mappings via Fourier transforms. Regarding the first contribution, the proof\n scheme provides another perspective on how the NTK regime arises from\n rescaling: redundancy in the weights due to resampling allows individual\n weights to be scaled down. Regarding the second contribution, the most notable\n transport mapping asserts that roughly $1 \/ \\delta^{10d},$ nodes are sufficient\n to approximate continuous functions, where $\\delta$ depends on the continuity\n properties of the target function. By contrast, nearly the same proof yields a\n bound of $1 \/ \\delta^{2d},$ for shallow ReLU networks; this gap suggests a\n tantalizing direction for future work, separating shallow ReLU networks and\n their linearization.",

        "Abstract": "Instead of directly utilizing an observed image including some outliers,\n noise or intensity inhomogeneity, the use of its ideal value (e.g. noise-free\n image) has a favorable impact on clustering. Hence, the accurate estimation of\n the residual (e.g. unknown noise) between the observed image and its ideal\n value is an important task. To do so, we propose an $\\ell_0$\n regularization-based Fuzzy $C$-Means (FCM) algorithm incorporating a\n morphological reconstruction operation and a tight wavelet frame transform. To\n achieve a sound trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression,\n morphological reconstruction is used to filter an observed image. By combining\n the observed and filtered images, a weighted sum image is generated. Since a\n tight wavelet frame system has sparse representations of an image, it is\n employed to decompose the weighted sum image, thus forming its corresponding\n feature set. Taking it as data for clustering, we present an improved FCM\n algorithm by imposing an $\\ell_0$ regularization term on the residual between\n the feature set and its ideal value, which implies that the favorable\n estimation of the residual is obtained and the ideal value participates in\n clustering. Spatial information is also introduced into clustering since it is\n naturally encountered in image segmentation. Furthermore, it makes the\n estimation of the residual more reliable. To further enhance the segmentation\n effects of the improved FCM algorithm, we also employ the morphological\n reconstruction to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based\n on the prototypes and smoothed labels, the segmented image is reconstructed by\n using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation. Experimental results\n reported for synthetic, medical, and color images show that the proposed\n algorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms other algorithms.",

HIVE-COTE combines\n multiple types of classifiers: each extracting information about a specific\n aspect of a time series, be it in the time domain, frequency domain or\n summarization of intervals within the series. However, HIVE-COTE (and its\n predecessor, FLAT-COTE) is often infeasible to run on even modest amounts of\n data. For instance, training HIVE-COTE on a dataset with only 1,500 time series\n can require 8 days of CPU time.

We\n propose a novel TSC algorithm, TS-CHIEF (Time Series Combination of\n Heterogeneous and Integrated Embedding Forest), which rivals HIVE-COTE in\n accuracy but requires only a fraction of the runtime.

Given\n a dataset upon which a self-supervised task is performed while predicting\n instantiations of a transformation, the hypothesis states that if the predicted\n instantiations of the transformations are already present in the dataset, then\n the representation learned will be less useful. The hypothesis was derived by\n observing a key constraint in the application of self-supervision using a\n particular transformation. This constraint, which we term the transformation\n conflict for this paper, forces a network learn degenerative features thereby\n reducing the usefulness of the representation. The VTSS hypothesis helps us\n identify transformations that have the potential to be effective as a\n self-supervision task. Further, it helps to generally predict whether a\n particular transformation based self-supervision technique would be effective\n or not for a particular dataset. We provide extensive evaluations on CIFAR 10,\n CIFAR 100, SVHN and FMNIST confirming the hypothesis and the trends it\n predicts.

While there is need for speed, inference in DNNs does not seem to have\n any need for precision. Many papers experimentally observe that DNNs can\n successfully run at almost ridiculously low precision.\n  The aim of this paper is two-fold: first, to shed some theoretical light upon\n why a DNNs FP accuracy stays high for low FP precision. We observe that the\n loss of relative accuracy in the convolutional steps is recovered by the\n activation layers, which are extremely well-conditioned. We give an\n interpretation for the link between precision and accuracy in DNNs.\n  Second, the paper presents a software framework for semi-automatic FP error\n analysis for the inference phase of deep-learning. Compatible with common\n Tensorflow\/Keras models, it leverages the frugally-deep Python\/C++ library to\n transform a neural network into C++ code in order to analyze the networks need\n for precision. This rigorous analysis is based on Interval and Affine\n arithmetics to compute absolute and relative error bounds for a DNN. We\n demonstrate our tool with several examples.",

        "Abstract": "The richness in the content of various information networks such as social\n networks and communication networks provides the unprecedented potential for\n learning high-quality expressive representations without external supervision.\n This paper investigates how to preserve and extract the abundant information\n from graph-structured data into embedding space in an unsupervised manner. To\n this end, we propose a novel concept, Graphical Mutual Information (GMI), to\n measure the correlation between input graphs and high-level hidden\n representations. GMI generalizes the idea of conventional mutual information\n computations from vector space to the graph domain where measuring mutual\n information from two aspects of node features and topological structure is\n indispensable. GMI exhibits several benefits: First, it is invariant to the\n isomorphic transformation of input graphs---an inevitable constraint in many\n existing graph representation learning algorithms; Besides, it can be\n efficiently estimated and maximized by current mutual information estimation\n methods such as MINE; Finally, our theoretical analysis confirms its\n correctness and rationality. With the aid of GMI, we develop an unsupervised\n learning model trained by maximizing GMI between the input and output of a\n graph neural encoder. Considerable experiments on transductive as well as\n inductive node classification and link prediction demonstrate that our method\n outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, and even sometimes\n exceeds the performance of supervised ones.",

        "Abstract": "Convolutional neural networks model the transformation of the input sensory\n data at the bottom of a network hierarchy to the semantic information at the\n top of the visual hierarchy. Feedforward processing is sufficient for some\n object recognition tasks. Top-Down selection is potentially required in\n addition to the Bottom-Up feedforward pass. It can, in part, address the\n shortcoming of the loss of location information imposed by the hierarchical\n feature pyramids. We propose a unified 2-pass framework for object segmentation\n that augments Bottom-Up \\convnets with a Top-Down selection network. We utilize\n the top-down selection gating activities to modulate the bottom-up hidden\n activities for segmentation predictions. We develop an end-to-end multi-task\n framework with loss terms satisfying task requirements at the two ends of the\n network. We evaluate the proposed network on benchmark datasets for semantic\n segmentation, and show that networks with the Top-Down selection capability\n outperform the baseline model. Additionally, we shed light on the superior\n aspects of the new segmentation paradigm and qualitatively and quantitatively\n support the efficiency of the novel framework over the baseline model that\n relies purely on parametric skip connections.",

Then, stacked hourglass network is employed\n to obtain preliminary locations of landmarks as well as their corresponding\n scores.

Although a large-scale and well-annotated datasets\n enhance the performance of detecting road pavement defects to some extent, it\n is still challengeable to derive a model which can perform reliably for various\n road conditions in practice, because it is intractable to construct a dataset\n considering diverse road conditions and defect patterns. To end this, we\n propose an unsupervised approach to detecting road defects, using Adversarial\n Image-to-Frequency Transform (AIFT). AIFT adopts the unsupervised manner and\n adversarial learning in deriving the defect detection model, so AIFT does not\n need annotations for road pavement defects. We evaluate the efficiency of AIFT\n using GAPs384 dataset, Cracktree200 dataset, CRACK500 dataset, and CFD dataset.\n The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach detects various\n road detects, and it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Adversarial training has been demonstrated as one of the most effective\n methods for training robust models to defend against adversarial examples.\n However, adversarially trained models often lack adversarially robust\n generalization on unseen testing data. Recent works show that adversarially\n trained models are more biased towards global structure features. Instead, in\n this work, we would like to investigate the relationship between the\n generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, as the\n robust local features generalize well for unseen shape variation. To learn the\n robust local features, we develop a Random Block Shuffle (RBS) transformation\n to break up the global structure features on normal adversarial examples. We\n continue to propose a new approach called Robust Local Features for Adversarial\n Training (RLFAT), which first learns the robust local features by adversarial\n training on the RBS-transformed adversarial examples, and then transfers the\n robust local features into the training of normal adversarial examples. To\n demonstrate the generality of our argument, we implement RLFAT in currently\n state-of-the-art adversarial training frameworks. Extensive experiments on\n STL-10, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that RLFAT significantly improves both the\n adversarially robust generalization and the standard generalization of\n adversarial training. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models capture more\n local features of the object on the images, aligning better with human\n perception.",

Our scheme learns action classes in an unsupervised manner using examples recorded by multiple cameras. Segmentation and clustering of action classes is based on a recently proposed motion descriptor which can be extracted efficiently from reconstructed volume sequences. Because our representation is independent of viewpoint, it results in segmentation and classification methods which are surprisingly efficient and robust. Our new method can be used as the first step in a semi-supervised action recognition system that will automatically break down training examples of people performing sequences of actions into primitive actions that can be discriminatingly classified and assembled into high-level recognizers.",

Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.",

These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkels conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences.

In this paper, we explicitly identify three important sources of variability: (1) viewpoint, (2) execution rate, and (3) anthropometry of actors, and propose a model of human actions that allows us to investigate all three. Our hypothesis is that the variability associated with the execution of an action can be closely approximated by a linear combination of action bases in joint spatio-temporal space. We demonstrate that such a model bounds the rank of a matrix of image measurements and that this bound can be used to achieve recognition of actions based only on imaged data. A test employing principal angles between subspaces that is robust to statistical fluctuations in measurement data is presented to find the membership of an instance of an action. The algorithm is applied to recognize several actions, and promising results have been obtained.",

The main strength of product\u2013form models, in particular of BCMP queueing networks, is that they combine a flexible formalism with efficient analysis techniques and solution algorithms. In this paper we provide an algorithm that starting from a high\u2013level description of a system, and from the definition of its components in terms of interacting sub\u2013systems, computes a multiple\u2013class and multiple\u2013chain BCMP queueing network.

A 0.18- \u03bcm CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz.

It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestrom-Kakeya theorem.",

An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block. However, most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks. In this paper, we propose an iterative blocking framework where the ER results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking, iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches. Iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing a block now save...",

This paper shows that four commonly-used Java profilers ( xprof , hprof , jprofile, and yourkit ) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement. This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental requirement for sampling based profilers: to be correct, a sampling-based profilermust collect samples randomly. We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects samples randomly, does not suffer from the above problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that are important to optimize; i...",

It is shown that transformation to CIELAB space is more effective for visual interpretation of image content.

Assuming random placement of blocks on multiple nodes of a continuous media server, our optimization objective is to redistribute a minimum number of media blocks after disk scaling. This objective should be met under two restrictions. First, uniform distribution and hence a balanced load should be ensured after redistribution. Second, the redistributed blocks should be retrieved at the normal mode of operation in one disk access and through low complexity computation. We propose a technique that meets the objective, while we prove that it also satisfies both restrictions. The SCADDAR approach is based on using a series of REMAP functions which can derive the location of a new block using only its original location as a basis.",

Expressed sequence tags (EST) analysis is a powerful, economical and time-efficient way of assembling information on the transcriptome.

Different from previous results, the delay interval 0, d(t) is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval 0, d(t), which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.",

This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specifi c problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems.

In a statistical fading environment, the interference effects become harder to predict. Information sources in a multihop wireless network can improve throughput and delay performance of data streams by implementing interference-aware packet injection mechanisms. Forcing packets to wait at the head of queues and coordinating packet injections among different sources enable effective control of copacket interference. In this paper, throughput and delay performance in interference-limited multihop networks is analyzed. Using nonlinear probabilistic hopping models, waiting times which jointly optimize throughput and delay performances are derived. Optimal coordinated injection strategies are also investigated as functions of the number of information sources and their separations. The resulting analysis demonstrates the interaction of performance constraints and achievable capa...",

However, this method involves large-scale, high-resolution datasets, which impose a serious multiple testing problem. Standard multiple testing methods fail to exploit the information from the complex dependence structure that varies across hypotheses in spectral, temporal, and spatial dimensions and result in a severe loss of power. They tend to control the false positives at the cost of hiding true positives. We introduce a new approach, called optimal discovery procedure (ODP) for identifying synchrony that is statistically significant. ODP maximizes the number of true positives for a given number of false positives, and thus offers a theoretical optimum for detecting significant synchrony in a multiple testing situation. We demonstrate the utility of this method with PLV data obtained from a visual search study. We also present simulation analysis to confirm the validity and rel...",

Thus, tight analytical bounds on actual performance are extremely useful for performance prediction and verification. Additionally, the structure of the bound provides insight into system behavior. A new expurgated 2-dimensional union bound is proposed and applied to an OFDM system in fast fading. This bound becomes extremely tight as the rate of fading L increases. Performance comparison of the new bound to a lower bound on a known expurgated union bound demonstrates a gain of up to 1.5 dB at P(e) = 10 2 for channel implicit diversity order of L = 4. A new simulated upper bound that uses a reduced state vector in a modified trellis search algorithm and a simulated lower bound that assumes limited knowledge of the ICI are also presented.

Traditionally, linear-spring contact models have been used to determine the natural compliance of multiple contact arrangements. However, these models are not supported by experiments or elasticity theory. We derive a closed-form formula for the stiffness matrix of multiple contact arrangements that admits a variety of nonlinear contact models, including the well-justified Hertz model. The stiffness matrix formula depends on the geometrical and material properties of the contacting bodies and on the initial loading at the contacts. We use the formula to analyze the relative influence of first- and second-order geometrical effects on the stability of multiple contact arrangements. Second-order effects, i.e., curvature effects, are often practically beneficial and sometimes lead to significant grasp stabilization. However, in some contact arrangements, curvature has a dominant destabilizing influence. Such contact...",

        "Abstract": "Two-operand binary addition is the most widely used arithmetic operation in modern datapath designs. To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate th...",

Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions.

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roches limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Marss rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).",

An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition.

Spin-modulated radial\n velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first\n time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600\n km\/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\n outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\n curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\n tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\n from velocities of ~500 km\/s to ~1000 km\/s. These findings have confirmed the\n theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\n Norton et al.

Evidence\n for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,\n confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is\n present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and\n hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the\n outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of\n material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and\n close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the\n accretion curtain model.",

Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of\n the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal\n significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8\n mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer\n periods in network regions.

        "Abstract": "We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice\n Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without\n blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the\n same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\n and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\n of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\n quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\n based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\n based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\n properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\n production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\n possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\n cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\n All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\n quasiequilibria.",

        "Abstract": "We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical\n plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).\n The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the\n mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron\n frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\n into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\n CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\n velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\n the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\n reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\n ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\n fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\n and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\n which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\n with the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\n electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\n phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\n energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\n wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\n phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\n electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\n relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\n applications are discussed in detail.",

We use the Whitham averaging\n method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable\n equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\n on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\n in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\n Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\n propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\n under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\n variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\n restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\n leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\n solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\n nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\n additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\n framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\n waves in slowly varying media.",

Our analysis on\n two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode\n sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\\Theta(m\\log n)$,\n without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.\n Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for\n analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and\n for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance\n of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both\n simulated and real DNA sequences.",

We prove a\n result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\n of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\n dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\n subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\n classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\n type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\n and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\n plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\n important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\n rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\n sufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\n other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\n subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\n conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\n containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\n cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\n with the deRham cohomology groups.

We find excellent agreement between the\n observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\n concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\n which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n -dM\/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1\/2},.

This feature does not derive from a literal\n ``universality of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\n variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\n cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\n Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\n instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\n radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1\/2}, or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3\/4}, -- alternative\n prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\n rho_h.

The gas temperature vanishes at the\n singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\n pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\n close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\n blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\n hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\n exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\n the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\n show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\n independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.",

        "Abstract": "We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in\n space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the\n space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field\n configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the\n pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the\n background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial\n fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\n pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\n sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\n the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\n can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\n study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In\n particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse\n space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition\n relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive\n modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this\n simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\n the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\n iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\n equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses\n can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings.",

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\n a=J\/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\n whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbits inclination with respect\n to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\n This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\n to the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\n previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\n the black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\n generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\n family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\n reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\n orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\n configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\n orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\n configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\n earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\n horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\n based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\n equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\n eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\n change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\n not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\n expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.",

The study and\n classification of pairs $(M,\\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In\n this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \\cite{Reeb}, states that a manifold\n admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.\n In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these\n lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \\cite{Ku-Ee}, classify manifolds having a\n real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In\n the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To\n do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities\n and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an\n elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle\n configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if\n other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,\n proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At\n this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\\F)$ of the foliation $\\F$, we\n consider {\\em{weakly stable},}, components, that we define as those components\n admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\\F)$ admits\n only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic\n to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefligers theorem. Finally, the existence of\n a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type\n result.",

We determine the solar system constraints due\n to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional\n source. We find a mass dependent, 1\/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential,\n and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We\n constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini\n spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newtons law, always finding\n extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We\n discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological\n acceleration.",

The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a\n wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission\n peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties\n of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are\n mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by\n the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated\n on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about\n two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the\n experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior\n within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or\n S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.",

By\n analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\n proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\n QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n $\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\n arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\n created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\n corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\n the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\n UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\n foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\n models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\n line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\n on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\n show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\n the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\n Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\n overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\n Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\n transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\n spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\n QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.",

Lynch proved the conjecture only\n for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the\n Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary\n connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns\n out that in these cases Lynchs parameter $\\lambda$ is equivalent to the\n expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct\n the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the\n average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased\n functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only\n functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.",

For the exceptional types, these\n decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$\n decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a\n somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$\n decomposition numbers from results of B\\ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on\n map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.\n These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and\n fixed integers $r_1\\le r_2\\le ...\\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\\pi_1\\le\n \\pi_2\\le ...\\le \\pi_l$ in Armstrongs generalised non-crossing partitions\n poset, where the poset rank of $\\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the \"block\n structure\" of $\\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies\n all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing\n partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain\n enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.\n Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain\n enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,\n in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrongs $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.",

The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after\n accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census\n of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially\n with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around\n a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery\n about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge.

Here we analyze the performance of\n Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\n from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\n entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\n which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\n transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\n beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\n refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\n to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\n i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\n performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\n quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\n subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\n approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\n (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\n that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\n systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\n show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\n slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\n filter can require significantly more feedback.",

        "Abstract": "We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal\n radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind\n nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of\n this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray\n emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a\n power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the\n X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than\n the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly\n offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7\n arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope\n Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio\n Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some\n areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index\n of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of\n L_{1400}, < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these\n observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a\n large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model\n for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we\n conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula\n formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly\n (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs),\n low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a\n low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3},) environment.",

        "Abstract": "This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an\n approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and\n representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the\n flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\n lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\n the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\n specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\n fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\n geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\n forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\n article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\n these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\n the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\n positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\n formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\n constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\n turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\n Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\n canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\n groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\n hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\n in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\n NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\n hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.",

Basaltic asteroids can be\n identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type\n in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic\n observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)\n 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have\n been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using\n the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been\n obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in\n November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep\n slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of\n 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence\n of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some\n questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has\n never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected\n it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused\n by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,\n together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16\n may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main\n Belt.",

For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the\n targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active\n stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,\n coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity\n will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric\n methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.\n  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods\n demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap\n for exoplanet discovery and characterization.",

In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\n in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\n This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\n problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\n permeability of the {\\it transformation media}, on the boundary of the cloaked\n objects. We write Maxwells equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\n electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\n the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\n self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\n equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n $\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu},_0$.

        "Abstract": "(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak\n lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging\n galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\n with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\n the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\n galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\n based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\n self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma\/m, using\n simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\n higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\n comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\n a new independent method of constraining sigma\/m, based on the non-observation\n of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\n new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma\/m < 1.25 cm^2\/g. If\n we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\n mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\n constraint of sigma\/m < 0.7 cm^2\/g, which comes from the consistency of the\n subclusters observed mass-to-light ratio with the main clusters, and with the\n universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\n matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\n improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\n most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2\/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\n standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",

The wavelength interval\n explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time\n render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.\n On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states\n of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in\n the literature.

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\n dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\n for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\n star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\n addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\n respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\n the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V.

        "Abstract": "The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength\n monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy\n distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with\n flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very\n high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet\n model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our\n multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce\n the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value\n for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due\n to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the\n high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence\n of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role\n in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to\n the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and\n gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton\n emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral\n variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis\n patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day\n time scales.",

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\n stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\n particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\n Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\n dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\n errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\n is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\n Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\n planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\n magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\n coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\n a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\n other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\n adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\n reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\n than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\n with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\n from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that\n the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary\n system.",

However, attempts to reconstruct\n the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more\n problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either\n during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the\n first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common\n envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive\n white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents\n interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope\n evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual\n formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most\n plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the\n common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget\n explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.",

Primordial binary frequencies in these\n models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and\n include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and\n the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a\n cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late\n times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the\n central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time\n -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core\n binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase\n (occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining).

A longstanding\n infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\n by adding extra `midpoint seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\n higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\n cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\n existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\n unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\n code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\n implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\n analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n R_{sep}, issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\n hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\n algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\n reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\n multi-jet observables.",

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white\n dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an\n elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,\n unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than\n earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\n region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\n be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\n slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\n centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\n mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\n stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\n evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\n neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\n that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\n accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\n of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\n CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\n at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\n candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\n characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\n explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).",

        "Abstract": "For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projection\n pursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high\n dimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weakly\n dependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model which\n is robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index is\n identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\n the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\n genuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\n the single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\n and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\n sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\n seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates\n with the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the rive\n flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.",

        "Abstract": "Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmic\n rays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along the\n extensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, the\n light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only\n attenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background component\n due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correction\n requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol\n phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given\n direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase\n function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)\n light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of\n the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image\n of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras.

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\n outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\n accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\n itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\n search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\n binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\n the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n +\/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\n days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\n brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\n periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\n half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\n clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\n is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\n predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\n those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\n circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\n timescale over which they might form planets.",

It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\n structure is significantly transformed.

Moreover, the spatiotemporal chaos arising from\n the far-field breakup of spiral waves does not gradually involve the whole\n space within that region. Our results are confirmed by means of computation\n spectra and nonlinear bifurcation of wave trains.

The survey allows us to investigate six\n families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5\n cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6).

In analyses\n undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance\n measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk\n objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo\n dark matter residing in such objects.\n  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white\n dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al.

Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined\n yielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for\n 3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too\n distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our\n observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were\n derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo\n membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be\n thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based\n solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric\n parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as\n derived from photometric techniques.

These\n effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying\n topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is\n described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this\n model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on\n the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of\n a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes\n through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population\n structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the\n effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local\n dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a\n continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations\n with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio\n becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial\n structure to the repeated prisoners dilemma we uncover a novel and\n counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains\n cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoners\n dilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of rich\n structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models\n with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and\n the emergence of global oscillations.",

        "Abstract": "We study the potential of the CNGS beam in constraining the parameter space\n of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an\n $\\mathcal{O},(\\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\\Dmq_\\Sbl$. We perform our\n analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded\n including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the\n channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\n space at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\n twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\n is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\n which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\n extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n \\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\n neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\n significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\n Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\n four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of\n $\\Dmq_\\Sbl \\gtrsim 0.1 \\eVq$, \\textit{i.e.}, when oscillations driven by this\n mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on\n $\\theta_{13},$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible\n existence of sterile neutrinos.",

        "Abstract": "We analyze the effect of gravitational radiation reaction on generic orbits\n around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in\n Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.\n This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation\n reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the\n Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of\n these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has\n computed the leading order evolution of the orbits Carter constant, which is\n linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in\n the spin (the coupling of the black holes spin to its own radiation reaction\n field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the\n quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric\n orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry\n axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a\n single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,\n to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we\n show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a\n system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional\n assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric\n spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.",

Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped\n product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas\n warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to\n the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the\n simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,\n possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that\n the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic\n type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are\n geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,\n however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit\n non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in\n any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D\n Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \\Phi_{ij},. In the case with\n ``twistfree (A_{ij},=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic\n case \\Phi_{ij}, is symmetric and eigenvectors of \\Phi_{ij}, coincide with those\n of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike\n directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing\n the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \\Phi_{ij}, is symmetric. The\n n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are\n briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.",

We carried out spectroscopic observations\n of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG\/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\n spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n 100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\n since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\n this period is about 10 m\/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\n period of 852 +\/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +\/- 6 m\/s.

We focus on the dissipative effects\n related to the expansion rate. At first order, we recover the expected result\n that the decay rate is determined by the local temperature. Beyond linear\n order, the decay rate has an additional contribution governed by the expansion\n parameter. This latter contribution is present even for stable particles in the\n vacuum. Finally, we analyze the long time behaviour of the propagator and\n briefly discuss applications to the trans-Planckian question.",

We show that the magnitudes of\n these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the\n locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the\n presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic\n quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.\n To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider\n all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and\n jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows\n the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth\n Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm\n (as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in\n the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,\n in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed\n counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm.

This makes\n the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\n reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\n detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\n younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\n disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures.

A key issue examined is the\n determination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often\n empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum\n from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be\n pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion\n rate, among a number of important factors.

        "Abstract": "We investigate the geometric phase of an atom inside an adiabatic radio\n frequency (rf) potential created from a static magnetic field (B-field) and a\n time dependent rf field. The spatial motion of the atomic center of mass is\n shown to give rise to a geometric phase, or Berrys phase, to the adiabatically\n evolving atomic hyperfine spin along the local B-field. This phase is found to\n depend on both the static B-field along the semi-classical trajectory of the\n atomic center of mass and an ``effective magnetic field of the total B-field,\n including the oscillating rf field. Specific calculations are provided for\n several recent atom interferometry experiments and proposals utilizing\n adiabatic rf potentials.",

        "Abstract": "We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of star\n formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a\n metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the\n radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic\n simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,\n led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to\n the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with\n cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with\n metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The\n simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5\n Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core\n reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4\n Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with\n metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share\n most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass\n proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=\n 10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower\n limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second\n generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more\n massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.",

We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the\n kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6\n solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.\n Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular\n clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs\n are a population of potential globular clusters.

This\n phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced\n second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these\n peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with\n extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.\n The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by\n random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.\n Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner\n halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the\n formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic\n properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion\n origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we\n anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of\n Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can\n help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in\n the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the\n myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\n problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\n source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\n decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\n coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\n the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\n coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\n of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\n runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\n runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\n the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\n using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\n the strategies on different routes.",

        "Abstract": "Two-operand binary addition is the most widely used arithmetic operation in modern datapath designs. To improve the efficiency of this operation, it is desirable to use an adder with good performance and area tradeoff characteristics. This paper presents an efficient carry-lookahead adder architecture based on the parallel-prefix computation graph. In our proposed method, we define the notion of triple-carry-operator, which computes the generate and propagate signals for a merged block which combines three adjacent blocks. We use this in conjunction with the classic approach of the carry-operator to compute the generate and propagate signals for a merged block combining two adjacent blocks. The timing-driven nature of the proposed design reduces the depth of the adder. In addition, we use a ripple-carry type of structure in the nontiming critical portion of the parallel-prefix computation network. These techniques help produce a good timing-area tradeoff characteristic. The experimental results indicate that our proposed adder is significantly faster than the popular Brent-Kung adder with some area overhead. On the adder hand, the proposed adder also shows marginally faster performance than the fast Kogge-Stone adder with significant area savings.",

The rotor side converter is controlled using the field-oriented control to produce three-phase stator voltages with constant magnitude and frequency at different rotor speeds. Moreover, the stator side converter, which is also controlled using field-oriented control, is primarily implemented to maintain the magnitude of the DC-link voltage. Furthermore, the intelligent PIDNN controller is proposed for both the rotor and stator side converters to improve the transient and steady-state responses of the DFIG system for different operating conditions. Both the network structure and on-line learning algorithm are introduced in detail. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is verified through experimentation.",

Because our representation is independent of viewpoint, it results in segmentation and classification methods which are surprisingly efficient and robust. Our new method can be used as the first step in a semi-supervised action recognition system that will automatically break down training examples of people performing sequences of actions into primitive actions that can be discriminatingly classified and assembled into high-level recognizers.",

        "Abstract": "In competitive domains, the knowledge about the opponent can give players a clear advantage. This idea lead us in the past to propose an approach to acquire models of opponents, based only on the observation of their input-output behavior. If opponent outputs could be accessed directly, a model can be constructed by feeding a machine learning method with traces of the opponent. However, that is not the case in the Robocup domain. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present a three phases approach to model low-level behavior of individual opponent agents. First, we build a classifier to label opponent actions based on observation. Second, our agent observes an opponent and labels its actions using the previous classifier. From these observations, a model is constructed to predict the opponent actions. Finally, the agent uses the model to anticipate opponent reactions. In this paper, we have presented a proof-of-principle of our approach, termed OMBO (Opponent Modeling Based on Observation), so that a striker agent can anticipate a goalie. Results show that scores are significantly higher using the acquired opponents model of actions.",

To render new virtual viewpoints, free-viewpoint systems rely on view synthesis. However, it is known that most objective metrics fail at predicting perceived quality of synthesized views. Therefore, it is legitimate to question the reliability of commonly used objective metrics to assess the quality of free-viewpoint video (FVV) sequences. In this paper, we analyze the performance of several commonly used objective quality metrics on FVV sequences, which were synthesized from decompressed depth data, using subjective scores as ground truth. Statistical analyses showed that commonly used metrics were not reliable predictors of perceived image quality when different contents and distortions were considered. However, the correlation improved when considering individual conditions, which indicates that the artifacts produced by some view synthesis algorithms might not be correctly handled by current metrics.",

        "Abstract": "Writing code that talks to hardware is a crucial part of any embedded project. Both productivity and quality are needed, but some flaws in the traditional development process make these requirements difficult to meet. We have recently introduced a new approach of dealing with hardware, based on the Devil language. Devil allows to write a high-level, formal definition of the programming interface of a peripheral circuit. A compiler automatically checks the consistency of a Devil specification, from which it generates the low-level, hardware-operating code. In our original framework, the generated code is dependent of the host architecture (CPU, buses, and bridges). Consequently, any variation in the hardware environment requires a specific tuning of the compiler. Considering the variability of embedded architectures, this is a serious drawback. In addition, this prevents from mixing different buses in the same circuit interface. In this paper, we remove those limitations by improving our framework in two ways. (i) We propose a better isolation between the Devil compiler and the host architecture. (ii) We introduce Trident, a language extension aimed at mapping one or several buses to each peripheral circuit.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a feedback implosion suppression (FIS) algorithm that reduces the volume of feedback information transmitted through the network without relying on any collaboration between users, or on any infrastructure other than the satellite network. Next generation satellite systems that utilize the Ka frequency band are likely to rely on various fade mitigation techniques, in order to guarantee a service quality that is comparable to other broadband technologies. User feedback would be a valuable input for a number of such components, however, collecting periodic feedback from a large number of users would result in the well-known feedback implosion problem. Feedback implosion is identified as a major problem when a large number of users try to transmit their feedback messages through the network, holding up a significant portion of the uplink resources and clogging the shared uplink medium. In this paper, we look at a system where uplink channel access is organized in time-slots. The goal of the FIS algorithm is to reduce the number of uplink time-slots hold up for the purpose of feedback transmission. Our analysis show that the FIS algorithm effectively suppresses the feedback messages of 95% of all active users, but still achieves acceptable performance results when the ratio of available time-slots to number of users is equal to or higher than 5%",

RGGs are appropriate for modeling ad hoc networks consisting of n mobile devices that are independently and uniformly distributed randomly in an area. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first paradigm to compute the subgraph probability of RGGs in a systematical way. In contrast to previous asymptotic bounds or approximation, which always assume that the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity, the closed-form formulas we derived herein are fairly accurate and of practical value. Moreover, computing exact subgraph probability in RGGs is shown to be a useful tool for counting the number of induced subgraphs, which explores fairly accurate quantitative property on topology of ad hoc networks.",

More retry numbers are allocated to packets of higher loss impact to achieve unequal error protection.

This omission produces an incomplete picture and might contribute to the conflicting empirical results. In this research we studied whether and how the socio political perspective can be used to explain the mixed results. Case study research was used to test whether the attitude towards the value of IT, destructive conflict, and a low level of trust influence the relationship between IT investments and business performance.",

        "Abstract": "Quickly and accurately predicting the performance based on the requirements for IP-based system implementations optimizes the design and reduces the design time and overall cost. This study describes a novel hybrid method for the word-length optimization of pipelined FFT processors that is the arithmetic kernel of OFDM-based systems. This methodology utilizes the rapid computing of statistical analysis and the accurate evaluation of simulation-based analysis to investigate a speedy optimization flow. A statistical error model for varying word-lengths of PE stages of an FFT processor was developed to support this optimization flow. Experimental results designate that the word-length optimization employing the speedy flow reduces the percentage of the total area of the FFT processor that increases with an increasing FFT length. Finally, the proposed hybrid method requires a shorter prediction time than the absolute simulation-based method does and achieves more accurate outcomes than a statistical calculation does.",

In case of the saturated load regulated CSMA, a trivial relationship between deterministic offered load to the channel at a particular fading channel condition and the maximum possible offered load has been shown. We further extend the load regulation concept into multi-channel domain. Both single and multi-channel load regulated CSMA improves the throughput of the system compared to the existing CSMA system which does not consider channel fading to control the packet transmissions.",

In this paper, we present a constraint solver targeting module placement in static and partial run-time reconfigurable systems. We use the constraint solver to compute feasible placement positions. Our placement model incorporates communication, implementation variants and device configuration granularity. In addition, we model heterogeneous resources such as embedded memory, multipliers and logic. Furthermore, we take into account that logic resources consist of different types including logic only LUTs, arithmetic LUTs with carry chains, and LUTs with distributed memory. Our work targets state of the art field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in both design-time and run-time applications. In order to evaluate our placement model and module placer implementation, we have implemented a repository containing 200 fully functional, placed and routed relocatable modules. The modules are used to implement complete systems. This validates the feasibility of both the model and the module placer. Furthermore, we present simulated results for run-time applications, and compare this to other state of the art research. In run-time applications, the results point to improved resource utilization. This is a result of using a finer tile grid and complex module shapes.",

        "Abstract": "Since the Standard Template Library (STL), generic libraries in C++ rely on concepts to precisely specify the requirements of generic algorithms (function templates) on their parameters (template arguments). Modifying the definition of a concept even slightly, can have a potentially large impact on the (interfaces of the) entire library. In particular the non-local effects of a change, however, make its impact difficult to determine by hand. In this paper we propose a conceptual change impact analysis (CCIA), which determines the impact of changes of the conceptual specification of a generic library. The analysis is organized in a pipe-and-filter manner, where the first stage finds any kind of impact, the second stage various specific kinds of impact. Both stages describe reachability algorithms, which operate on a conceptual dependence graph. In a case study, we apply CCIA to a new proposal for STL iterator concepts, which is under review by the C++ standardization committee. The analysis shows a number of unexpected incompatibilities and, for certain STL algorithms, a loss of genericity.",

        "Title": "Multiprocessors May Reduce System Dependability under File-Based Race Condition Attacks",
        "Abstract": "Attacks exploiting race conditions have been considered rare and \"low risk\". However, the increasing popularity of multiprocessors has changed this situation: instead of waiting for the victim process to be suspended to carry out an attack, the attacker can now run on a dedicated processor and actively seek attack opportunities. This change from fortuitous encountering to active exploiting may greatly increase the success probability of race condition attacks. This point is exemplified by studying the TOCTTOU (Time-of- Check-to-Time-of-Use) race condition attacks in this paper. We first propose a probabilistic model for predicting TOCTTOU attack success rate on both uniprocessors and multiprocessors. Then we confirm the applicability of this model by carrying out TOCTTOU attacks against two widely used utility programs: vi and gedit. The success probability of attacking vi increases from low single digit percentage on a uniprocessor to almost 100% on a multiprocessor. Similarly, the success rate of attacking gedit jumps from almost zero to 83%. These case studies suggest that our model captures the sharply increased risks, and hence the decreased dependability of our systems, represented by race condition attacks such as TOCTTOU on the next generation multiprocessors.",

We developed an information extraction system that can extract useful information from full-text nanotoxicity related publications. This information extraction system consists of five components: raw data transformation into machine readable format, data preprocessing, ontology-based named entity recognition, rule-based numerical attribute extraction from both tables and unstructured text, and relation extraction among entities and attributes. The information extraction system is applied on a dataset made of 94 publications, and results in an acceptable accuracy. By storing extracted data into a table according to relations among the data, a dataset that can be used to predict nanomaterial environmental impact is obtained. Such a system is unique in current nanomaterial community, and can help nanomaterial scientists and practitioners quickly locate useful information they need without spending lots of time reading articles.",

However, the problem, that it is difficult to use the wide bandwidth efficiently with TCP Reno, has been pointed out. HSTCP is one of the several new versions of TCP that are proposed to address this problem, but when its flows compete with TCP Reno flows at the same link, HSTCP gains most of the bandwidth and it is impossible to conduct fair transfer. In order to address this problem, we propose a two-level ECN marking to increase the frequency of congestion controls of HSTCP flows, holding its throughput. We evaluate our proposal through computer simulations, and the results show that our proposal mitigates bandwidth allocation to HSTCP, promoting fair transfer with TCP Reno.",

In this work, we study the problem of leakage power minimization in dual-Vdd and dual-Vth designs in the presence of significant Vth variation. The impact of the uncertainty in Vth on leakage power and timing are studied through probabilistic analytical models. We develop probabilistic models for timing slack and leakage power considering threshold variations with the objective of achieving an optimal selection of Vth. An analysis of the models indicate that, in the presence of variability, the value of the second Vth must be about 30mV higher than the Vth value obtained without considering variability. We show that our proposed method for the selection of Vth yields the lowest leakage power ratio of the dual-Vdd and dual-Vth versus the single-Vdd and single-Vth designs. In addition, the proposed models can be used to determine the ideal values for the second Vdd and Vth values in the context of variability for a variety of process conditions.",

The multidisciplinary expertise needed for such reviews is not available at any one institution, resulting in the need for remote collaboration, while the sensitive nature of the information requires secure transmission and controlled access of data. The intended users of the appliance are researchers, engineers, medical doctors, government regulators, automobile and restraint manufacturers, insurance company representatives, and others who are interested in understanding the types and causes of injuries to children involved in motor vehicle crashes. The ultimate goal is to devise engineering solutions that prevent similar injuries from occurring in the future. The collaboration appliance (called Telecenter) enables the following activities: (1) the distributed asynchronous collection of digital content needed for each crash case review under a scheme that consistently organizes content across multiple cases; (2) the secure, Web-based remote participation of users in case-review meetings that involve viewing of case-specific content, live communication (written or verbal), multimedia access and sharing (slide presentations\/ images), and use of Web resources; and (3) archival and post-review access of case reviews for follow-up activities and other functions (e.g., statistics, search, and networking). The Telecenter design supports audio conferencing, remote delivery and viewing of slide presentations, and other collaboration features also available in commercial and public-domain collaboration middleware products. However, it goes beyond existing solutions by also embedding a specific workflow and content organization suited for traffic injury reviews, supporting spatio-temporal role-based access control, distributed management of content and seamless integration of existing services. The current status and experience from using an early prototype of the Telecenter in actual case reviews are discussed, along with planned extensions to its functionality.",

        "Abstract": "Key establishment in sensor networks is a challenging problem because asymmetric key cryptosystems are unsuitable for use in resource constrained sensor nodes, and also because the nodes could be physically compromised by an adversary. We present three new mechanisms for key establishment using the framework of pre-distributing a random set of keys to each node. First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to significantly strengthen random key predistributions strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links. Finally, we present the random-pairwise keys scheme, which perfectly preserves the secrecy of the rest of the network when any node is captured, and also enables node-to-node authentication and quorum-based revocation.",

Standard deviation of CT-values was employed as a physical index for evaluating image noise, and streak artifact was quantitatively evaluated using our devised Gumbel evaluation method. z -Axis automatic tube current modulation technique will improve image noise and streak artifact, compared with fixed tube current technique, and will make it possible to significantly reduce radiation doses at lung levels while maintaining the same image quality as fixed tube current technique.",

This model improves the observable fact that the system might experience shortage during the screening duration and also takes quantity discount into account. This approach has not been discussed in previous integrated supplier-buyer coordination models. The expected annual integrated total cost function is derived and properties and theorems are explored to help develop an algorithm. A solution procedure, free from the convexity associated with an algorithm is established to find the optimal solution. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed procedure and algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is made to investigate the effects of five important parameters (the inspect rate, the annual demand, the defective rate, the holding cost, and the receiving cost) on the optimal solution. Managerial insights are also discussed.",

The algorithm will facilitate design of an optical probe for an implantable fluorescent sensor, which holds potential for monitoring many parameters of biomedical interest. Results are analyzed with respect to output light intensity as a function of radial distance from source, angle of exit for escaping photons, and sensor fluorescence (SF) relative to tissue autofluorescence (AF). A sensitivity study was performed to elucidate the effects on the output due to changes in optical properties, thickness of tissue layers, thickness of the sensor layer, and both tissue and sensor quantum yields. The optical properties as well as the thickness of the stratum corneum, epidermis, (tissue layers through which photons must pass to reach the sensor) and the papillary dermis (tissue distal to sensor) are highly influential. The spatial emission profile of the SF is broad compared that of the tissue fluorescence and the ratio of sensor to tissue fluorescence increases with distance from the source. The angular distribution of escaping photons is more concentrated around the normal for SF than for tissue AF. The information gained from these simulations will he helpful in designing appropriate optics for collection of the signal of interest.",

        "Abstract": "Background: Currently primary scientific data, especially that dealing with biodiversity, is neither easily discoverable nor accessible. Amongst several impediments, one is a lack of professional recognition of scientific data publishing efforts. A possible solution is establishment of a \u2018Data Publishing Framework\u2019 which would encourage and recognise investments and efforts by institutions and individuals towards management, and publishing of primary scientific data potentially on a par with recognitions received for scholarly publications. Discussion: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of primary biodiversity data publishing, and conceptualises a \u2018Data Publishing Framework\u2019 that would help incentivise efforts and investments by institutions and individuals in facilitating free and open access to biodiversity data. It further postulates the institutionalisation of a \u2018Data Usage Index (DUI)\u2019, that would attribute due recognition to multiple players in the data collection\/creation, management and publishing cycle. Conclusion: We believe that institutionalisation of such a \u2018Data Publishing Framework\u2019 that offers socio-cultural, legal, technical, economic and policy environment conducive for data publishing will facilitate expedited discovery and mobilisation of an exponential increase in quantity of \u2018fit-for-use\u2019 primary biodiversity data, much of which is currently invisible.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we present a detailed analysis on how the critical charge (Q\/sub crit\/) of a circuit node, usually employed to evaluate the probability of transient fault (TF) occurrence as a consequence of a particle hit, depends on transistors sizing. We derive an analytical model allowing us to calculate a nodes Q\/sub crit\/ given the size of the nodes driving gate and fan-out gate(s), thus avoiding time costly electrical level simulations. We verified that such a model features an accuracy of the 97% with respect to electrical level simulations performed by HSPICE. Our proposed model shows that Q\/sub crit\/ depends much more on the strength (conductance) of the gate driving the node, than on the node total capacitance. We also evaluated the impact of increasing the conductance of the driving gate on TFs propagation, hence on soft error susceptibility (SES). We found that such a conductance increase not only improves the TF robustness of the hardened node, but also that of the whole circuit.",

        "Abstract": "Since the third wave in human\u2013computer interaction HCI, research on user experience UX has gained momentum within the HCI community. The focus has shifted from systematic usability requirements and measures towards guidance on designing for experiences. This is a big change, since design has traditionally not played a large role in HCI research. Yet, the literature addressing this shift in focus is very limited. We believe that the field of UX research can learn from a field where design and experiential aspects have always been important: design research. In this article, we discuss why design is needed in UX research and how research that includes design as a part of research can support and advance UX design practice. We do this by investigating types of design-inclusive UX research and by learning from real-life cases of UX-related design research. We report the results of an interview study with 41 researchers in three academic research units where design research meets UX research. Based on our interview findings, and building on existing literature, we describe the different roles design can play in research projects. We also report how design research results can inform designing for experience methodologically or by providing new knowledge on UX. The results are presented in a structured palette that can help UX researchers reflect and focus more on design in their research projects, thereby tackling experience design challenges in their own research.",

In this paper we address the Hera methodology and specifically explain the integration model that covers the different aspects of integration, and the adaptation model, that specifies how the generated presentations are adaptable (e.g. device capabilities, user preferences). The Hera software framework provides a set of transformations that allow a WIS to go from integration to presentation generation. These transformations are based on RDF(S), and we show how RDF(S) has proven its value in combining all relevant aspects of WIS design. In this way, RDF(S) being the foundation of the Semantic Web, Hera allows the engineering of Semantic Web Information Systems (SWIS).",

In the anticipation phase, differential activity was most prominent over midline electrodes and parieto-occipital sensors. Differences between non-reward- and reward-predicting cues were localized in the cuneus and later in the dorsal PCC, suggesting a modulation by potential reward information during early visual processing, followed by a coarse emotional evaluation of the cues. Oscillatory analysis revealed increased theta power after non-reward cues over fronto-central sites. In the beta range, power decreased with the magnitude of the potential reward and increased with re- action time, probably reflecting the influence of the striatal response to potential reward on the sensorimotor cortex. At reward delivery, negative prediction errors led to a larger mediofrontal negativity. The spatiotem- poral evolution of reward processing was modulated by prediction error: whereas differences were located in PCC and putamen in the prediction error comparison, in the case of expected outcomes they were located in PCC, ACC and parahippocampal gyrus. In the oscillatory realm, theta power was largest following rewards and, in the case of non-rewards, was largest when these were unexpected. Higher beta activity following re- wards was also observed in both modalities, but MEG additionally showed a significant power decrease for this condition over parieto-occipital sensors. Our results show how visual, limbic and striatal structures are involved in the different stages of reward anticipation and delivery, and how theta and beta oscillations have a prominent role in the processing of these stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "Robust and accurate lip region segmentation is of vital importance for lip image analysis. However, most of the current techniques break down in the presence of mustaches and beards. With mustaches and beards, the background region becomes complex and inhomogeneous. We propose in this paper a novel multi-class, shape-guided FCM (MS-FCM) clustering algorithm to solve this problem. For this new approach, one cluster is set for the object, i.e. the lip region, and a combination of multiple clusters for the background which generally includes the skin region, lip shadow or beards. The proper number of background clusters is derived automatically which maximizes a cluster validity index. A spatial penalty term considering the spatial location information is introduced and incorporated into the objective function such that pixels having similar color but located in different regions can be differentiated. This facilitates the separation of lip and background pixels that otherwise are inseparable due to the similarity in color. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides accurate lip-background partition even for the images with complex background features like mustaches and beards.",

The key idea is a data-driven model for the factorization where the most salient features in the data are used to express the remaining features. More precisely, given a data matrix X, the algorithm identifies a matrix C that satisfies X \u2248 CX and some linear constraints. The constraints are chosen to ensure that the matrix C selects features; these features can then be used to find a low-rank NMF of X. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach has guarantees similar to those of the recent NMF algorithm of Arora et al. (2012). In contrast with this earlier work, the proposed method extends to more general noise models and leads to efficient, scalable algorithms. Experiments with synthetic and real datasets provide evidence that the new approach is also superior in practice. An optimized C++ implementation can factor a multigigabyte matrix in a matter of minutes.",

        "Abstract": "Existing convex relaxation-based approaches to reconstruction in compressed sensing assume that noise in the measurements is independent of the signal of interest. We consider the case of noise being linearly correlated with the signal and introduce a simple technique for improving compressed sensing reconstruction from such measurements. The technique is based on a linear model of the correlation of additive noise with the signal. The modification of the reconstruction algorithm based on this model is very simple and has negligible additional computational cost compared to standard reconstruction algorithms, but is not known in existing literature. The proposed technique reduces reconstruction error considerably in the case of linearly correlated measurements and noise. Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the technique. The technique is demonstrated with application to low-rate quantization of compressed measurements, which is known to introduce correlated noise, and improvements in reconstruction error compared to ordinary Basis Pursuit De-Noising of up to approximately 7dB are observed for 1bit\/sample quantization. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared to Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding which it is demonstrated to outperform in terms of reconstruction error for sparse signals with a number of non-zero coefficients greater than approximately 1\/10th of the number of compressed measurements.",

        "Abstract": "The classification performance of nearest prototype classifiers largely relies on the prototype learning algorithms, such as the learning vector quantization (LVQ) and the minimum classification error (MCE). This paper proposes a new prototype learning algorithm based on the minimization of a conditional log-likelihood loss (CLL), called log-likelihood of margin (LOGM). A regularization term is added to avoid over-fitting in training. The CLL loss in LOGM is a convex function of margin, and so, gives better convergence than the MCE algorithm. Our empirical study on a large suite of benchmark datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm yields higher accuracies than the MCE, the generalized LVQ (GLVQ), and the soft nearest prototype classifier (SNPC).",

In this paper, we propose a problem-driven collaborative requirements elicitation approach, with the purpose of helping identify and extract the requirements of the Internetwares (a complex and new software paradigm). The basic idea of our approach is that the requirements of the software systems should be stated by stakeholders in an objective way (i.e. problem-identifying-solving way). That is, first identify the problems existed in the as-is problem domain, and then find the solutions to the problems. The solutions to the problems are the requirements of the envisioned software systems. To this end, we propose the structure of problems and a collaborative process for achieving the solutions.",

We attempt to minimize total weighted tardiness on parallel batch machines with incompatible job families and unequal ready times of the jobs. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we propose two different decomposition approaches. The first approach forms fixed batches, then assigns these batches to the machines using a genetic algorithm (GA), and finally sequences the batches on individual machines. The second approach first assigns jobs to machines using a GA, then forms batches on each machine for the jobs assigned to it, and finally sequences these batches. Dispatching and scheduling rules are used for the batching phase and the sequencing phase of the two approaches. In addition, as part of the second decomposition approach, we develop variations of a time window heuristic based on a decision theory approach for forming and sequencing the batches on a single machine.",

        "Abstract": "Associating fMRI image datasets with the available literature is crucial for the analysis and interpretation of fMRI data. Here, we present a human brain function mapping knowledge-base system (BrainKnowledge) that associates fMRI data analysis and literature search functions. BrainKnowledge not only contains indexed literature, but also provides the ability to compare experimental data with those derived from the literature. BrainKnowledge provides three major functions: (1) to search for brain activation models by selecting a particular brain function; (2) to query functions by brain structure; (3) to compare the fMRI data with data extracted from the literature. All these functions are based on our literature extraction and mining module developed earlier (Hsiao, Chen, Chen. Journal of Biomedical Informatics 42, 912\u2013922, 2009), which automatically downloads and extracts information from a vast amount of fMRI literature and generates co-occurrence models and brain association patterns to illustrate the relevance of brain structures and functions. BrainKnowledge currently provides three co-occurrence models: (1) a structure-to-function co-occurrence model; (2) a function-to-structure co-occurrence model; and (3) a brain structure co-occurrence model. Each model has been generated from over 15,000 extracted Medline abstracts. In this study, we illustrate the capabilities of BrainKnowledge and provide an application example with the studies of affect. BrainKnowledge, which combines fMRI experimental results with Medline abstracts, may be of great assistance to scientists not only by freeing up resources and valuable time, but also by providing a powerful tool that collects and organizes over ten thousand abstracts into readily usable and relevant sources of information for researchers.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of radio resource allocation for QoS support in the downlink of a cellular OFDMA system. The major impairments considered are cochannel interference (CCI) and frequency selective fading. The allocation problem involves assignment of base stations and subcarriers, bit loading, and power control, for multiple users. We propose a three-stage, low-complexity, heuristic algorithm to distribute radio resources among multiple users according to their individual QoS requirements, while at the same time maintaining the QoS of already established links in all the cochannel cells. The allocation objective is to minimize the total transmit power, which adds to reducing CCI. Simulation results show a superior performance of the proposed method when compared to classical radio resource management techniques. Our scheme allows us to achieve almost 6 times higher capacity (sum data rate) than the method based on FDMA with power control, at a blocking probability of 0.02.",

Alpha channels are used to introduce statistical dependencies between the frequency bands. This approach extends a method called detail texturing, which does not use alpha channels to model higher statistical properties of the resulting texture. Other approaches to generate textures with specied statistical properties, like DeBonet 1997, are not suitable for real-time use and would require storage of the generated texture. Spectral texturing is very easy to implement, runs on all contemporary 3d graphics cards, and is especially suitable for naturalistic textures in real-time applications which are viewed from a large range of distances.",

        "Title": "Exploring component-based approaches in forest landscape modeling",
        "Abstract": "Forest management issues are increasingly required to be addressed in a spatial context, which has led to the development of spatially explicit forest landscape models. The numerous processes, complex spatial interactions, and diverse applications in spatial modeling make the development of forest landscape models difficult for any single research group. New developments in componentbased modeling approaches provide a viable solution. Component-based modeling breaks a monolithic model into small, interchangeable, and binary components. They have these advantages compared to the traditional modeling work: 1) developing a component is a much smaller task than developing a whole model, 2) a component can be developed using most programming languages, since the interface format is binary, and 3) new components can replace the existing ones under the same model framework; this reduces the duplication and allows the modeling community to focus resources on the common products, and to compare results. In this paper, we explore the design of a spatially explicit forest landscape model in a component-based modeling framework, based on our work on object-oriented forest landscape modeling. We examine the representation of the major components and the interactions between them. Our goal is to facilitate the use of the component-based modeling approach at the early stage of spatially explicit landscape modeling. \uf6d9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules. Availability: An (experimental) web service using rules obtained by our method is provided at http:",

This algorithm is the solution to an optimization problem that minimizes a linear combination of data transmission power and the resulting weighted intercell interference with pricing factors at each BS and maintains the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) at user terminals. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed distributed algorithm and derive conditions for its existence. We characterize the impact of the pricing factors in expanding the operational range of SINR targets at user terminals in a power-efficient manner. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm converges to a network-wide equilibrium point by balancing and stabilizing the intercell interference levels and assigning power optimal beamforming vectors to the BSs. The results also show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in closely following the performance limits of its centralized coordinated beamforming counterpart.",

        "Abstract": "Authentication watermarking schemes using block-wise watermarks for tamper localization are vulnerable to the Holliman---Memon attack. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the Wongs localization scheme (Proceedings of the IS&T PIC, Portland) to resist this attack. A unique image index scheme is used for computing the authentication signature that is embedded in the least significant bit-plane of the block. The informed detector estimates the correct image index by using the side information about the watermarked image. The image index estimation from the fake image can definitely be an alternative to keeping a directory of image indices. So it is not necessary to manage the database of image indices for the verification purpose. The authenticity measure is defined to quantify the attack severity by taking the connectivity among possible authentic blocks into consideration. There are more blocks verified as authentic when this measure is high for a fake image constructed using this attack. As such, the blocks for a fake image can be chosen from a reduced number of database images. The blocks from any such image are to be connected with each other to maximize the authenticity measure. Thus, the attackers task to generate a fake image of reasonable perceptual quality becomes increasingly difficult. With the proposed method there is no loss or ambiguity in localization after the Holliman---Memon attack and content tampering in an image. The localization accuracy in the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulation results and is equal to the chosen block size, similar to the Wongs scheme.",

        "Abstract": "Radio equipped mobile devices have enjoyed tremendous growth in the past few years. We observe that in the near future it might be possible to build a network that routes delay-tolerant packets by harnessing user mobility and the pervasive availability of wireless devices. Such a delay-tolerant network could be used to supplement wireless infrastructure or provide service where none is available. Since mobile devices in a delay-tolerant network forward packets to nearby users, the devices can use short-range radio, which potentially reduces device power consumption and radio contention. The design of a user mobility based delay-tolerant network raises two key challenges: determining the connectivity of such a network, and determining the latency characteristics and replication requirements of routing algorithms in such a network. To determine realistic contact patterns, we collected user mobility data by conducting two user studies. We outfitted groups of students with instrumented wireless-enabled PDAs that logged pairwise contacts between study participants over a period of several weeks. Experiments conducted on these traces show that it is possible to form a delay-tolerant network based on human mobility. The network has good connectivity, so that routes exist between almost all study participants via some multi-hop path. Moreover, it is possible to effectively route packets with modest replication.",

For a long period, the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) was used in cheminformatics applications ignoring a very critical flaw, namely that it is not unique even for simple structures. Other definitions like the set of relevant cycles heal this flaw; however they are sometimes chemically not meaningful and can become exponential in size.

URFs match the common chemical sense of a molecules ring topology. The definition results in a unique ring description consisting of a number of ring prototypes which is at most quadratic in the number of atoms. In this talk, we will present the algorithm, benchmarks as well as several examples demonstrating the usefulness of URFs.",

        "Abstract": "The capillary instability of a magnetically anisotropic liquid cylinder and jets, such as Nematic liquid crystals (LC), in magnetic fields, is considered using an energy approach. The boundary problem is solved in the linear approximation of the anisotropy \/spl chi\/\/sub a\/ of the magnetic susceptibility \/spl chi\/. The effect of the anisotropy, in the region 1 |\/spl chi\/|>| \/spl chi\/\/sub a\/| \/spl chi\/\/sup 2\/, can be strong enough to counteract and even reverse the tendency of the field to enhance stabilization by increasing the cut-off wave number k\/sub s\/, beyond the conventional one set by Rayleigh. It is shown that the elastic effect, which is typical of LC, is significant on the scale of nano-jets, where it prevails over the magnetic effect. The jet instability is determined by surface tension, elasticity, and magnetic permeability and anisotropy. The relative influence of the elasticity and permeability on the jet stability depends on its radius. This is particularly true on the nano-scale.",

The potential benefits include improved speed, accuracy, and scalability. Where conventional HMM-based speech recognition systems decode words directly, our IR-based system first decodes subword units. These are then mapped to a target word by the IR system. In this decoupled system, the IR serves as a lightweight, data-driven pronunciation model. Our proposed method is evaluated in the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task, and our best system has 12% fewer errors than a comparable HMM classifier. We show that even using an inexpensive IR weighting scheme (TF-IDF) yields a 3% relative error rate reduction while maintaining all of the advantages of the IR approach.",

        "Abstract": "In modern era of computing, there is a need of development in data analysis and decision making. Most of our tools are crisp, deterministic and precise in character. But general real life situations contains uncertainties. To handle such uncertainties many theories are developed such as fuzzy set, rough set, rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces etc. But all these theories have their own limitations. To overcome the limitations, the concept of soft set is introduced. But, soft set also fails if the attributes in the information system are almost identical rather exactly identical. In this paper, we propose a decision making model that consists of two processes such as preprocess and postprocess to mine decisions. In preprocess we use rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces to get the almost equivalence classes whereas in postprocess we use soft set techniques to obtain decisions. The proposed model is tested over an institutional dataset and the results show practical viability of the proposed research.",

        "Abstract": "The impact of parental and peer attachment on four Internet usage motives and Internet addiction was compared using path modelling of survey data from 1,577 adolescent Malaysian school students. The model accounted for 31 percent of Internet addiction score variance. Lesser parental attachment was associated with greater Internet addiction risk. Psychological escape motives were more strongly related to Internet addiction than other motives, and had the largest mediating effect upon the parental attachment\u2013addiction relationship. Peer attachment was unrelated to addiction risk, its main influence on Internet usage motives being encouragement of use for social interaction. It is concluded that dysfunctional parental attachment has a greater influence than peer attachment upon the likelihood of adolescents becoming addicted to Internet\u2013related activities. It is also concluded that the need to relieve dysphoria resulting from poor adolescent\u2013parent relationships may be a major reason for Internet addiction, and that parents\u2019 fostering of strong bonds with their children should reduce addiction risk.",

While several workflow analysis approaches have been defined previously, these approaches do not give precise feedback, thus making it hard for a designer to pinpoint the exact cause of modeling errors. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for analyzing and diagnosing workflows based on integer programming (IP). Each workflow model is translated into a set of IP constraints. Faulty control flow connectors can be easily detected using the approach by relaxing the corresponding constraints. We have implemented this diagnosis approach in a tool called DiagFlow which reads and diagnoses XPDL models using an existing open source IP solver as a backend. We show that the diagnosis approach is correct and illustrate it with realistic examples. Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be extended to handle a variety of new constraints, as well as to support new workflow patterns. Results of testing on large process models show that DiagFlow outperforms a state of the art tool like Woflan in terms of the solution time.",

The network aims to maintain the connection between a base station (BS) and nodes by way of multihopping.

A routing protocol proposed in this paper is capable of building a route using unicast-based route discovery process without route request flooding. A proposed MAC protocol satisfies the requirement of maintaining accessibility and a short delay even in emergency circumstances. We discuss an analytical model based on a Markov process.

The hypothesis is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification accuracy when using different wavelets\/filters for EEG analysis. When classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the wavelet\/filter used, ranged from 6.92% to 11.99%, almost twofold. Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of the six standard wavelets tested. Similarly, when differentiating between preparation for left- or right-hand movements, classification using the SNAP was more accurate (10.03% error) than for four out of five of the standard wavelets (9.54% to 12.00% error) and internationally competitive (7% error) on the 2001 NIPS competition test set. Phenomena shown only in maps of discriminatory EEG activity may explain why the SNAP appears to have promise for improving EEG wavelet analysis. It represents the initial exploration of a potential family of EEG-specific wavelets.",

Bringing the data into a centralized site is a bottleneck in terms of the bandwidth when compared with the size of the data. In this paper for multiclass SVM we propose an algorithm which builds a global SVM model by merging the local SVMs using a distributed approach(DSVM). And the global SVM will be communicated to each site and made it available for further classification. The experimental analysis has shown promising results with better accuracy when compared with both the centralized and ensemble method. The time complexity is also reduced drastically because of the parallel construction of local SVMs. The experiments are conducted by considering the data sets of size 100s to hundred of 100s which also addresses the issue of scalability.",

The work presented here takes aim at examining ICT use that crosses these scales of influence and accountability. We report on a year long ethnographic investigation conducted at a variety of social service outlets to understand how a shared information system crosses the boundaries of these very distinct organizations.

It is important that this semantic complexity is checked and analyzed for optimality and trustworthiness prior to deployment. Petri nets are a formal method that successfully provides behavioural analysis. A shortcoming of Petri nets is that the data exchanged between business activities abstract too far away from the importance of data in actual business processes.

        "Abstract": "We present a framework for the provision of deterministic end-to-end bandwidth guarantees in wireless ad hoc networks. Guided by a set of local feasibility conditions, multi-hop sessions are dynamically offered allocations, further translated to link demands. Using a distributed Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol nodes adapt to the demand changes on their adjacent links by local, conflict-free slot reassignments. As soon as the demand changes stabilize, the nodes must incrementally converge to a TDMA schedule that realizes the global link (and session) demand allocation.We first derive sufficient local feasibility conditions for certain topology classes and show that trees can be maximally utilized.We then introduce a converging distributed link scheduling algorithm that exploits the logical tree structure that arises in several ad hoc network applications.Decoupling bandwidth allocation to multi-hop sessions from link scheduling allows support of various end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) objectives. We focus on the max-min fairness (MMF) objective and design an end-to-end asynchronous distributed algorithm for the computation of the session MMF rates. Once the end-to-end algorithm converges, the link scheduling algorithm converges to a TDMA schedule that realizes these rates.We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through an implementation over an existing wireless technology. This implementation is free of restrictive assumptions of previous TDMA approaches: it does not require any a-priori knowledge on the number of nodes in the network nor even network-wide slot synchronization.",

        "Abstract": "Cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) are a special class of parallel manipulators that are driven by cables instead of rigid links. Due to the unilateral property of the cables, all the driving cables in a fully-constrained CDPM must always maintain positive tension. As a result, tension analysis is the most essential issue for these CDPMs. By drawing upon the mathematical theory from convex analysis, a sufficient and necessary tension-closure condition is proposed in this paper. The key point of this tension-closure condition is to construct a critical vector that must be positively expressed by the tension vectors associated with the driving cables. It has been verified that such a tension-closure condition is general enough to cater for CDPMs with different numbers of cables and DOFs. Using the tension-closure condition, a computationally efficient algorithm is developed for the tension-closure pose analysis of CDPMs, in which only a limited set of deterministic linear equation systems need to be resolved. This algorithm has been employed for the tension-closure workspace analysis of CDPMs and verified by a number of computational examples. The computational time required by the proposed algorithm is always shorter as compared to other existing algorithms.",

Instead of analyzing the whole training set in one optimization step, the data are split into subsets and optimized separately with multiple SVMs. The partial results are combined and filtered again in a Cascade of SVMs, until the global optimum is reached. The Cascade SVM can be spread over multiple processors with minimal communication overhead and requires far less memory, since the kernel matrices are much smaller than for a regular SVM. Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x - 10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor. Parallel implementations on a cluster of 16 processors were tested with over 1 million vectors (2-class problems), converging in a day or two, while a regular SVM never converged in over a week.",

These multipole-equivalent methods (MEMs) were compared to the conventional mixed boundary-value method (BVM) in a realistic torso model with up to 20% noise added to body-surface potentials and \/spl plusmn\/1 cm error in heart position and size. Optimal regularization was used for all inverse solutions. The relative error of inferred heart-surface potentials of the MEM was significantly less (p<0.05) than that of the BVM using zeroth-order Tikhonov regularization in 10 of the 12 cases tested. These improvements occurred with a fourth-degree (24 coefficients) or smaller multipole moment. From these multipole coefficients, heart-surface potentials can be found at an unlimited number of heart-surface locations. Our indirect methods for estimating heart-surface potentials based on multipole inference appear to offer significant improvement over the conventional direct approach.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel method to derive exact closed-form ergodic capacity and outage probability expressions for correlated Rayleigh fading channels with receive diversity. Unlike the existing works, the proposed method employ a simple approach for the capacity and outage analysis for receiver diversity channels operating at different signal-to-noise ratios depicted in the diagonal elements of matrix \u03a9. With x being the channel gain vector, random variable of the form Y(a)=a + x\u2217\u03a9 x is considered. Novelty of the work resides in the fact that the distribution of Y(a) is accurately determined by employing Fourier representation of unit step function followed by complex integration in a straight forward way.

        "Abstract": "Variable selection methods are routinely applied in regression modeling to identify a small number of descriptors which \"best\" explain the variation in the response variable. Most statistical packages that perform regression have some form of stepping algorithm that can be used in this identification process. Unfortunately, when a subset of p variables measured on a sample of n objects are selected from a set of k(>p) to maximize the squared sample multiple regression coefficient, the significance of the resulting regression is upwardly biased. The extent of this bias is investigated by using Monte Carlo simulation and is presented as an inflation factor which when multiplied by the usual tabulated F ratio gives an estimate of the true 5% critical value. The results show that selection bias can be very high even for moderate-size data sets. Selecting three variables from 50 generated at random with 20 observations will almost certainly provide a significant result if the usual tabulated F values are used. An interpolation formula is provided for the calculation of the inflation factor for different combinations of (n, p, k). Four real data sets are examined to illustrate the effect of correlated descriptor variables on the degree of inflation.",

        "Abstract": "In the recent years, the peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network has been a promising architecture for multimedia streaming services besides its common use for efficient file sharing. By simply increasing the number of peers, the P2P overlay network can meet the high bit rate requirements of multimedia applications. Optimal peer selection for newly joining peers is one of the important problems, especially in wireless networks which have limited resources and capacity, since the peer selection process has a direct impact on the throughput of the underlay network and the co-existing unicast traffic. In this paper we tackle the problem of peer selection for streaming applications over wireless ad hoc networks. We devise a novel peer selection algorithm which maximizes the throughput of the underlay network, and at the same time makes P2P streaming friendly towards the co-existing data traffic. The proposed receiver based rate allocation and peer selection (RPS) algorithm is derived using the network utility maximization (NUM) framework. The algorithm solves the peer selection and rate allocation problem distributedly while optimally adapting the medium access control (MAC) layer parameters and is easily extensible to large P2P networks. Simulation results show that by using the proper price exchange mechanism, the peer receivers can effectively maximize the throughput of the underlay network by intelligently selecting its source peers.",

An HFCC pump-vest and half chest-lung simulation, with 23 lung generations, has been developed using inertance, compliance, viscous friction relationships, and Newtons second law. The simulation has proven to be useful in studying the effects of parameter variations and nonlinear effects on HFCC system performance and pulmonary system response. The simulation also reveals HFCC waveform structure and intensity changes in various segments of the pulmonary system. The HFCC system simulation results agree with measurements, indicating that the HFCC energy transport mechanism involves a mechanically induced pulsation or vibration waveform with average velocities in the lung that are dependent upon small air displacements over large areas associated with the vest-chest interface. In combination with information from lung physiology, autopsies and a variety of other lung modeling efforts, the results of the simulation can reveal a number of therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract": "Large-scale traffic networks can be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes are connected through a set of links that cannot be loaded above their traffic capacities. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks. Simulations performed on complex communication networks point out the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This iterative approach generates a series of surface meshes that capture different levels of detail of the underlying structure. At the highest level of detail, the resulting surface mesh generated by our approach uses only about 10 percent of the triangles in comparison to the Marching Cube (MC) algorithm, even in settings where almost no image noise is present. Our approach also eliminates the so-called \"staircase effect,\" which voxel-based algorithms like the MC are likely to show, particularly if nonuniformly sampled images are processed. Finally, we show how the presented algorithm can be parallelized by subdividing 3D image space into rectilinear blocks of subimages. As the algorithm scales very well with an increasing number of processors in a multithreaded setting, this approach is suited to process large image data sets of several gigabytes. Although the presented work is still computationally more expensive than simple voxel-based algorithms, it produces fewer surface triangles while capturing the same level of detail, is more robust toward image noise, and eliminates the above-mentioned \"staircase\" effect in anisotropic settings. These properties make it particularly useful for biomedical applications, where these conditions are often encountered.",

Today we have already functions like lane departure warning and automatic cruise control (ACC) for pretty well defined driving environments, such as highways and primary roads. Recent research activities concentrate on more complex environments, such as city traffic with a wide variety of traffic participants moving in an unpredictable manner, e.g. bikes, pedestrians, children, and even animals, and under changing weather and lighting conditions. The ITRS semiconductor roadmap for microelectronics forecasts a continued doubling of transistor capacity per chip every 2 to 2.5 years enabling billion transistor ASIC designs in the near future. Multi processor system on chip (MPSoC) solutions with 8, 16 or even more standard RISC CPU cores, mega-bytes of fast (ns access latencies) on-chip SRAM memories, giga-byte per second interconnect buses or NoC (network on chip) meshes, high-speed serial I\/Os and, last but not least, million gate equivalent dedicated hardware accelerator functions in eFPGA (embedded field programmable gate array) logic are becoming reality on a single silicon substrate. Examples of current research projects shall illustrate our perception on how this tremendous increase in functionality and computational performance per chip area may impact automotive control unit (ACU) architectures for driver assistance applications. The AutoVision processor is a dynamically reconfigurable MPSoC prototype where video-specific pixel processing engines are on-the-fly loaded or exchanged without interrupting regular system operations. For the time being, pixel processing engines cover functions such as object edge detection or luminance segmentation, and are implemented as dedicated hardware accelerators to ensure real-time frame processing capabilities of the AutoVision processor. Dynamic replacement of processing engines ensures an automatic and area efficient adaptation to various driving conditions. Segmented objects are, in a subsequent step, characterized by means of standard MPEG-7 descriptors and entered as search criteria into traffic scene analysis databases. Goal is to obtain a clean distinction between passenger cars, trucks, and big rectangular traffic signs, and to identify pedestrians or bikers in complex traffic situations. The AutoVision processor project is supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the special emphasis research programme \"reconfigurable computing\".",

Image analysis of such data poses a challenging problem due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratios that makes individual volumes simply too noisy to allow reliable structural interpretation. This requires using averaging techniques to boost the signal-to-noise ratios, a common practice in electron microscopy single particle analysis where they have proven to be very powerful in elucidating high resolution structure. Although there are significant similarities in the way data is processed, several new problems arise in the tomography case that have to be properly dealt with. Such problems involve dealing with the missing wedge characteristic of limited angle tomography, the need for robust and efficient 3D alignment routines, and design of methods that account for diverse conformations through the use of classification. We present a framework for reconstruction via alignment, classification and averaging of volumes obtained from limited angle electron tomography, providing a powerful tool for high resolution structure determination and description of conformational variability in a biological context",

In this paper, we leverage a recently-developed analysis for the complex LMS algorithm 2 to illuminate the performance relationships between the ACLMS and CCLMS algorithms. Our analysis shows that the ACLMS algorithm can potentially achieve a lower steady-state mean-squared error as compared to that of CCLMS, but the convergence speed of ACLMS is slowed in the presence of highly non-circular complex-valued input signals.

        "Title": "Extending wireless sensor network lifetime through order-based genetic algorithm",
        "Abstract": "Extending the lifetime is a key issue in wireless sensor networks. An effective way to extend the lifetime is to partition the sensors into several covers and activate the covers one by one. Thus, the more the covers, the longer the lifetime. To find the maximum number of covers has been modeled as the Set K-Cover problem. In this paper we propose using order-based genetic algorithm to solve the Set K-Cover problem for extending the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm needs neither an upper bound nor any assumption about the maximum number of covers. Experimental results show that the order-based genetic algorithm can achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently.",

The main idea is based on the consideration of the bounded uncertainty in predictor input, and it is a typical Errors-in-Variables problem. The robust design is based on the linear-in-parameters ESN (Echo State Network) model. By minimizing the worst-case residual induced by the bounded perturbations in the echo state variables, the robust predictor is obtained in coping with the uncertainty in the noisy time series. In the experiment, the classical Mackey-Glass 84-step benchmark prediction task is investigated. The prediction performance is studied for the nominal and robust design of ESN predictors.",

        "Abstract": "Maximally parallel multiset rewriting systems (MPMRS) give a convenient way to express relations between unstructured objects. The functioning of various computational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register machines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS are Turing universal; however, a direct translation leads to quite a large number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete devices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest number of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization strategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We apply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine (Korec (1996) 9) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules. Since MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport rules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number of rules for those systems.",

        "Abstract": "The OSCAR 14 cluster installation toolkit was created by the Open Cluster Group (OCG) for one particular type of High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. OSCAR is currently one of the widely used cluster installation toolkits; it boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads and active mailing lists. OSCAR has expanded its area with several sub-projects targeting other types of HPC clusters. Each of these projects share a core set of OSCAR code, including the OSCAR Database and its access API, \"ODA\" (OSCAR Database API). The ODA abstraction layer, consisting of a database schema and corresponding API, hides a commodity back-end database (e.g., MySQL 15). Because OSCAR and its sub-projects are targeted at new, innovative environments (including non-HPC environments), there are significant issues with managing various configurations of each project. For example, as we previously showed 8, \u0093previous versions of ODA were unable to represent the complex, ever-growing set of data required to accurately describe the clusters that it manages. Further, its API was extremely complex, requiring a steep learning curve for OSCAR developers\u0094. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a new database schema to deal with these issues. This new version of ODA has not only resolved the above problems but also, as proposed in our previous paper, enabled storage and retrieval of various configuration information, and encouraged data re-use between the main OSCAR project and its derivative projects. In addition, the new version of ODA has sped up the OSCAR installation process. This document presents a simpler, highly flexible design and implementation of ODA slated to be included in OSCAR v5.0. It also suggests a blueprint for maintaining the database modules of ODA in a systematic, organized way.",

This paper focuses on the processes of higher-order learning that occur through BSTEs. Based on the conceptual frameworks from theories of organizational learning, policy-oriented learning, and diffusion of innovation, we identify two types of learning: the first type occurs among the participants in the experiment and their immediate professional networks; the second type occurs in the society at large. Both types play a key role in the societal transition towards sustainable mobility systems.

        "Abstract": "During a complete running stride, which involves significant periods of flight during which no legs are contacting the ground, a quadruped cannot employ static stability techniques. Instead, the corrective forces necessary to maintain dynamic stability must be applied during the short stance intervals inherent to high-speed running. Because of this complexity and the large coupled forces required to run, much of the research on the control of quadruped running has focused on planar systems which are not required to simultaneously control attitude in all three dimensions. The 3D trot controller presented here overcomes these and other complexities to control a trot up to 3.75 m\/s, approximately 3 body lengths per second, and turning rates up to 20 deg\/s. The biomimetic method of banking into a high-speed turn is also investigated here. Along with the details of the attitude control algorithm, a set of control principles for high-speed legged motion is presented. These principles, such as the need to counteract the disturbance of swing leg return and the usefulness of force redistribution during stance, are not dependent on a particular scale or actuation scheme and can be applied to a wider range of legged systems.",

Images are modelled as Gaussian random fields of independent pixels, with piecewise constant mean and variance. This model captures variations in both intensity (mean value) and texture (variance). Segmentation thus amounts to detecting changes in the mean and\/or variance. One algorithm is based on an adaptive (greedy) rectangular recursive partitioning scheme. The second algorithm is an optimally pruned \"wedgelet\" decorated dyadic partitioning. We compare the two schemes with an alternative constant variance dyadic CART (classification and regression tree) scheme which accounts only for variations in mean, and demonstrate their performance on SAR images.",

        "Abstract": "Motivation: Genetic networks are often described statistically using graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring the network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an ill-posed inverse problem.#R##N##R##N#Methods: We introduce a novel framework for small-sample inference of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically, we focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are now frequently used to describe gene association networks and to detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach is based on (1) improved (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation of the degree of freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based on false discovery rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology.#R##N##R##N#Results: Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity (power) and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The authors have implemented the approach in the R package GeneTS that is freely available from http:\/\/www.stat.uni-muenchen.de\/~strimmer\/genets\/, from the R archive (CRAN) and from the Bioconductor website.#R##N##R##N#Contact: korbinian.strimmer@lmu.de",

They focus on crosstalk due to capacitive coupling between a pair of lines. Closed form equations are derived that quantify the severity of these effects and describe qualitatively the dependence of these effects on the values of circuit parameters, the rise\/fall times of the input transitions, and the skew between the transitions. For noise propagation, they present a new way for predicting the output waveform produced by an inverter due to a nonsquare wave pulse at its input. To expedite the computation of the response of a logic gate to an input pulse, the authors have developed a novel way of modeling such gates by an equivalent inverter. The results of their analysis provide conditions that must be satisfied by a sequence of vectors used for validation of designs as well as post-manufacturing testing of devices in the presence of significant crosstalk. They present data to demonstrate accuracy of their results, including example runs of a test generator that uses these results.",

However, economic (cost of masks) and technological (deep micron manufacturability) trends favor FPGA as an implementation platform. In order to combine the advantages of both platforms and alleviate their disadvantages, recently a number of approaches, such as structured ASIC\/regular fabrics, have been proposed. Our goal is to introduce an approach that has the same objective, but is orthogonal to those already proposed. The idea is to implement several ASIC designs in such a way that they share the datapath, memory structure, and several bottom layers of interconnect, while each design has only a few unique metal layers. We identified and addressed two main problems in our quest to develop a CAD flow for realization of such designs. They are: (i) the creation of the datapath, and (ii) the identification of common and unique interconnects for each design. Both problems are solved optimally using ILP formulations. We assembled a design flow platform using two new programs and the Trimaran and Shade tools. We quantitatively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the approach using the Mediabench benchmark suite.",

In this model, two edge or node-disjoint paths are provisioned for each demand pair. We obtain the first non-trivial approximation algorithms for buy-at-bulk network design in the 1+1 model for both edge and node-disjoint protection requirements. Our results are for the single-cable cost model, which is prevalent in optical networks. More specifically, we present a constant-factor approximation for the single-sink case, and an O(log 3 n) approximation for the multi-commodity case.

We compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of a generative baseline on a challenging real-world dataset of customer letters. When the kernel used by the classifier is linear, the performance improvement is marginal but the proposed system is approximately 15 times faster than the baseline. If we use a non-linear kernel devised for this task, we obtain a 15\\% relative reduction of the error but the detector is approximately 15 times slower.",

But these technologies also introduce many design options at system\/chip design level, hard to grasp during the complete design cycle. Because of the sequential nature of current design practices, designers are often forced to introduce design margins to meet required specications, resulting in sub-optimal designs. In this paper we introduce new design methodology and practical tool chain, called PathFinding Flow, that can help designers to easily trade-off between different system level design choices, physical design and\/or technology options and understand their impact on typical design parameters such as cost, performance and power. Proposed methodology and the tool chain will be demonstrated on a practical case study, involving fairly complex Multi-Processor System-on-Chip using Network-on-Chip for communication medium. With this example we will show how High-Level Synthesis can be used to quickly move from high-level to RTL models, necessary for accurate physical prototyping for both computation and communication. We will also show how the possibility of design iteration, through the mechanism of feedback based on physical information from physical prototyping, can improve design performance. Finally, we will show how we can move in no time from traditional 2D to 3D design and how we can measure benets of such design choice.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, an approach to design information systems for traceability is proposed. The paper applies gozinto graph modelling for traceability of the goods flow. A gozinto graph represents a graphical listing of raw materials, parts, intermediates and subassemblies, which a process transforms into an end product, through a sequence of operations. Next, the graphical listing has been translated into a reference data model that is the basis for designing an information system for tracking and tracing. Materials that are modelled this way represent production and\/or purchase lots or batches. The composition of a certain end product is then represented through modelling all its constituent materials along with their intermediate relations. By registering all relations between sub-ordinate and super-ordinate material lots, a method of tracking the composition of the end product is obtained. When the entire sequence of operations required for manufacturing an end product adheres to this registering of relations, a multilevel bill of lots can be compiled. That bill of lots then, provides the necessary information to determine the composition of a material item out of component items. These composition data can be used to recall any items having consumed a certain component of specific interest (e.g., deficient), but also to certify product quality or to pro-actively adjust production processes to optimise the product quality in relation to its production characteristics (e.g., scarcity, costs or time).",

        "Abstract": "Engineering knowledge is complex. Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once. Normally, individual models and behaviours are taught in several courses, by different teaching staff and in separate years of study. This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.",

        "Abstract": "In an effort to address students complaints regarding the tedious and frustrating nature of the practical component of the departments introductory communication course we embarked on a restructuring exercise. The restructuring of this component of the course shows promise based on preliminary results. The students are obtaining higher grades and gave the practical component a more favorable rating. Additionally the restructuring exercise allows for the addition of several more experiments enabling us to cover a broader portion of the course in the practical component. This paper looks at the changes that were made in the restructuring exercise and present preliminary results on the improvement in students grade which can be attributed to this exercise. Over 16% of students are now obtaining grades over 80% compare to 0% before the restructuring exercise. Results from students evaluations of the practical component of the course before and after the restructuring exercise is also presented, which shows an effective 24% improvement in the student rating.",

        "Abstract": "Minimizing communication and synchronization costs is crucial to the realization of the performance potential of parallel computers. This paper presents a general technique which uses a global data-flow framework to optimize communication and synchronization in the context of the one-way communication model. In contrast to the conventional send\/receive message-passing communication model, one-way communication is a new paradigm that decouples message transmission and synchronization. In parallel machines with appropriate low-level support, this may open up new opportunities not only to further optimize communication, but also to reduce the synchronization overhead. We present optimization techniques using our framework for eliminating redundant data communication and synchronization operations. Our approach works with the most general data alignments and distributions in languages like High Performance Fortran (HPF) and uses a combination of the traditional data-flow analysis and polyhedral algebra. Empirical results for several scientific benchmarks on a Cray T3E multiprocessor machine demonstrate that our approach is successful in reducing the number of data (communication) and synchronization messages, thereby reducing the overall execution times.",

        "Abstract": "Pattern mining algorithms are often much easier applied than quantitatively assessed. In this paper we address the pattern evaluation problem by looking at both the capability of models and the difficulty of target concepts. We use four different data mining models: frequent itemset mining, k-means clustering, hidden Markov model, and hierarchical hidden Markov model to mine 39 concept streams from the a 137-video broadcast news collection from TRECVID-2005. We hypothesize that the discovered patterns can reveal semantics beyond the input space, and thus evaluate the patterns against a much larger concept space containing 192 concepts defined by LSCOM. Results show that HHMM has the best average prediction among all models, however different models seem to excel in different concepts depending on the concept prior and the ontological relationship. Results also show that the majority of the target concepts are better predicted with temporal or combination hypotheses, and there are novel concepts found that are not part of the original lexicon. This paper presents the first effort on temporal pattern mining in the large concept space. There are many promising directions to use concept mining to help construct better concept detectors or to guide the design of multimedia ontology.",

In this context adaptation becomes a fundamental requirement that must be elicited along with the other functional and non functional requirements. Beside modelling, effective adaptation also demands means to trigger it at runtime as soon as the actual behavior of the composition deviates from stated requirements. This paper extends traditional goal models with adaptive goals to support continuous adaptation. Goals become live, runtime entities whose satisfaction level is dynamically updated. Furthermore, boundary infringement triggers adaptation capabilities. The paper also provides a methodology to trace goals onto the underlying composition, assess goals satisfaction at runtime, and activate adaptation consequently.

We show that state-dependent ( s, S) and base-stock policies are optimal for stochastic inventory systems with and without fixed costs. The state of the system reflects our knowledge of advance demand information. We also determine conditions under which advance demand information has no operational value. A numerical study allows us to obtain additional insights and to evaluate strategies to induce advance demand information.",

        "Abstract": "A new design methodology for a pattern generator is proposed, formulated in the context of on-chip BIST. The design methodology is circuit-specific and uses synthesis techniques to design BIST generators. The pattern generator consists of two components: a pseudorandom pattern generator (like an LFSR or, preferably, a GLFSR) and a combinational logic to map the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. This combinational logic is synthesized to produce a given set of target patterns by mapping the outputs of the pseudorandom pattern generator. It is shown that, for a particular CUT, an area-efficient combinational logic block can be designed\/synthesized to achieve 100 (or almost 100) percent single stuck-at fault coverage using a small number of test the This method is significantly different from weighted pattern generation and can guarantee testing of all hard-to-detect faults without expensive test point insertion. Experimental results on common benchmark netlists demonstrate that the fault coverage of the proposed pattern generator is significantly higher compared to conventional pattern generation techniques. The design technique for the logic mapper is unique and can be used effectively to improve existing pattern generators for combinational logic and scan-based BIST structures.",

We have developed four prototype robots based on four proposed methods for preliminarily announcing and indicating to people the speed and direction of upcoming movement of mobile robot moving on two-dimensional plane. We observed significant difference between when there was a preliminary-announcement and indication (PAI) function and when there was not even in each experiment. Therefore the effect of preliminary-announcement and indication of upcoming operation was declared. In addition the feature and effective usage of each type of preliminary-announcement and indication method were clarified. That is, the method of announcing state of operation just after the present is effective when a person has to judge to which direction he should get on immediately due to the feature that simple information can be quickly transmitted. The method of indicating operations from the present to some future time continuously is effective when a person wants to avoid contact or collision surely and correctly owing to the feature that complicated information can be accurately transmitted. We would like to verify the result in various conditions such as the case that traffic lines are obliquely crossed.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, diversity techniques have evolved into highly attractive technology for wireless communications in different forms. For instance, the channel fluctuations of the users in a network are exploited as multiuser diversity by scheduling the user with the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When fading is slow, beamforming at a multiple antenna transmitter is used to induce artificial channel fluctuations to ensure multiuser diversity in the network. Such a beamforming scheme is called opportunistic beamforming since the transmitter uses random beamforming to artificially induce opportunism in the network 1. Opportunism requires a large number of users in the system in order to reach the performance of the true beamforming that uses perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper we investigate the benefit of having partial CSI at an opportunistic transmitter. In the investigation, we focus on the maximum normalized SNR scheduling where users feedback consists of SNR relative to its channel gain. We show that opportunism can be beneficially used to increase the average throughput of the system. Simulations support the analytical average throughput results obtained as the amount of CSI and the number of users vary.",

We also present three modifications that relax one or more constraints in the optimal formulation in order to obtain smaller run times. We present experimental analysis by applying the formulations on an MPEG decoder algorithm. All results are compared against two existing techniques. Our formulations result in large system-level power reductions (max: 48.2%, min: 15.92%, avg: 31.9%).

The identification of genes involved in seed development is of great interest, but systematic spatial analyses of gene expression on maize seeds at the cell level have not yet been performed. MASISH is an online database holding information for gene expression spatial patterns in maize seeds based on in situ hybridization experiments. The web-based query interface allows the execution of gene queries and provides hybridization images, published references and information of the analyzed genes. Availability: http:\/\/masish.uab.cat\/ Contact: cvsgmp@cid.csic.es The maize kernel is classified botanically as a caryopsis. In consequence it is a fruit composed by one seed and the remnants of the seed coats and nucellus and is permanently enclosed in the pericarp. The endosperm occupies most of the seed and is basically a storage organ that accumulates starch and proteins. The aleurone layer is part of the endosperm and consists in a continuous layer of large cubical cells which accumulate protein and lipid granules and surrounds most of the endosperm. In the area of the pedicel, which connects the seed to the mother plant, the cells adopt a special morphology, typical of transfer cells, and form the basal transfer cell layer. The embryo consists of an embryonic axis and a single cotyledon, which is called the scutellum. The embryo axis is formed by the plumule, covered by the coleoptile and the radicle, covered by coleorhiza. All these organs are almost completely surrounded by the scutellum, an organ whose major function is to accumulate nutrient reserves, mainly lipids and proteins. A single layer of cells directly in contact with the endosperm, which is called the scutellar epithelium, is important in the digestion and transport of the nutrients from the endosperm to the embryo axis during germination. Both endosperm and embryo derive from the fusion of gametes, but while the embryo is derived from the fertilized egg, triploid endosperm is derived from fertilized polar nuclei. Surrounding the endosperm and embryo lays the pericarp, a protective organ derived from maternal tissues (more information at http:\/\/masish.uab.cat\/masish\/images\/maizeseedanatomy.pdf).

        "Abstract": "This paper presents, for the first time, a unified blind method for multi-image super-resolution (MISR or SR), single-image blur deconvolution (SIBD), and multi-image blur deconvolution (MIBD) of low-resolution (LR) images degraded by linear space-invariant (LSI) blur, aliasing, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The proposed approach is based on alternating minimization (AM) of a new cost function with respect to the unknown high-resolution (HR) image and blurs. The regularization term for the HR image is based upon the Huber-Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a type of variational integral that exploits the piecewise smooth nature of the HR image. The blur estimation process is supported by an edge-emphasizing smoothing operation, which improves the quality of blur estimates by enhancing strong soft edges toward step edges, while filtering out weak structures. The parameters are updated gradually so that the number of salient edges used for blur estimation increases at each iteration. For better performance, the blur estimation is done in the filter domain rather than the pixel domain, i.e., using the gradients of the LR and HR images. The regularization term for the blur is Gaussian (L2 norm), which allows for fast noniterative optimization in the frequency domain. We accelerate the processing time of SR reconstruction by separating the upsampling and registration processes from the optimization procedure. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-life images (from a novel computational imager) confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "Recent research in generalizing quantum computation from 2-valued qudits to d-valued qudits has shown practical advantages for scaling up a quantum computer. A further generalization leads to quantum computing with hybrid qudits where two or more qudits have different finite dimensions. Advantages of hybrid and d-valued gates (circuits) and their physical realizations have been studied in detail by Muthukrishnan and Stroud Multi-valued logic gates for quantum computation, Phys. Rev. A 62 (2000) 052309. 10, Daboul et al. Quantum gates on hybrid qudits, J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2525-2536. 5, and Bartlett et al. Quantum encodings in spin systems and harmonic oscillators, Phys. Rev. A 65 (2002) 052316. 17. In both cases, a quantum computation is performed when a unitary evolution operator, acting as a quantum logic gate, transforms the state of qudits in a quantum system. Unitary operators can be represented by square unitary matrices. If the system consists of a single qudit, then Tilma et al. Generalized Euler angle parameterization for SU(N), J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 35 (2002) 10467-10501. 15 have shown that the unitary evolution matrix (gate) can be synthesized in terms of its Euler angle parametrization. However, if the quantum system consists of multiple qudits, then a gate may be synthesized by matrix decomposition techniques such as QR factorization and the cosine-sine decomposition (CSD). In this article, we present a CSD based synthesis method for n qudit hybrid quantum gates, and as a consequence, derive a CSD based synthesis method for n qudit gates where all the qudits have the same dimension.",

If the quantization error is correlated with the input signal, then the spectrum of the quantization error will contain spurious peaks. Although analytical formulas describing this effect exist, numerical evaluation can take much effort. This brief provides approximations for the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of a uniform quantizer with a single sinusoidal input, with and without additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that the SFDR increases by approximately 8 dB\/bit, in case there is no noise. Generalizing this result to multitone inputs results in an additional 2 dB\/bit per additional tone. Additive Gaussian noise decorrelates the sinusoid(s) and the quantization error, which results in a dramatic increase in SFDR.",

The aim of this paper is to design a suspension mechanism which utilizes the advantages of both passive suspension and active suspension rover. Both the design considered here are simpler than the existing suspension mechanisms in the sense that the number of links as wells as the number of joints have been significantly reduced without compromising the climbing capability of the rover. We first analyze the kinematics of the five wheeled rover and its motion pattern while climbing an obstacle and try to deduce the same motion pattern and capability in the four wheeled rover. Both the suspension mechanism consists of two planar closed kinematic chains on each side of the rover. We also deduce the control strategy for the active suspension rover wherein only two actuators are used to control the internal configuration of the rover. To the best of authors knowledge this is the minimum number of actuators required to control the internal configuration of a active suspension while operating on a fully 3D rough terrain. Extensive uneven terrain simulations are performed for both 5-wheeled and 4-wheeled rover and a comparative analysis has been done on maximum coefficient of friction and torque requirements.",

Recently, malformed BGP messages have become a threat to the operational community as they repeatedly cause BGP session resets until identified. However, the identification of the message itself is often difficult in large ISP networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method for real-time identification of these messages by using passively collects BGP messages. Our method focuses on the frequency of observed attributes and values of prefixes advertised by each AS. Based on our heuristics that common attributes are observed at similar time scale, we periodically measure the usage frequency of attributes from BGP messages observed in real-time and mark attributes and values used by minority of the AS as suspicious. We verify the efficiency of our method using BGP data obtained from operational networks.",

However, for most applications that need large and heterogeneous groups or crowds, more automatic methods of generating large numbers of humans, animals or other characters are needed. Fortunately, depending on the context, it is not the case that all types of variety are equally important. Sometimes quite simple methods for creating variations, which do not over-burden the computing resources available, can be as effective as, and perceptually equivalent to, far more resource-intensive approaches.

With the growing popularity of mobile devices in the last few years, attacks targeting them are also surging. Existing mobile malware detection techniques, which are often borrowed from solutions to Internet malware detection, do not perform as effectively due to the limited computing resources on mobile devices.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we propose VirusMeter, a novel and general malware detection method, to detect anomalous behaviors on mobile devices. The rationale underlying VirusMeter is the fact that mobile devices are usually battery powered and any malicious activity would inevitably consume some battery power. By monitoring power consumption on a mobile device, VirusMeter catches misbehaviors that lead to abnormal power consumption. For this purpose, VirusMeter relies on a concise user-centric power model that characterizes power consumption of common user behaviors. In a real-time mode, VirusMeter can perform fast malware detection with trivial runtime overhead. When the battery is charging (referred to as a battery-charging mode), VirusMeter applies more sophisticated machine learning techniques to further improve the detection accuracy. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, we have implemented a VirusMeter prototype on Nokia 5500 Sport and used it to evaluate some real cellphone malware, including FlexiSPY and Cabir. Our experimental results show that VirusMeter can effectively detect these malware activities with less than 1.5% additional power consumption in real time.",

Using queueing analysis, we derive performance parameters: average delay and packet loss rate, in closed-form expressions. These expressions are functions of the source, wireless channel and compensation mechanism parameters. Moreover, the trade-off relationship between delay and packet loss rate is revealed, which is controlled by the parameter of lagging bound.

We analyze how the presence of haptic feedback on the steering wheel could help drivers to perform a visually-guided task by providing relevant information like vehicle speed and trajectory. Starting from these considerations, a Context-Dependant Steering Wheel force feedback (CDSW) had been developed, able to provide to the driver the most suitable feeling of the vehicle dynamics according to the driven context. With a driving simulator the CSWD software had been tested twice and then compared with a traditional steering wheel.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of reverse engineering is to convert a large point cloud into an accurate, fair and consistent CAD model. For a class of conventional engineering objects we have the a priori assumption that the object is bounded exclusively by simple, analytic surfaces. In this case it is possible to generate the model with a minimal amount of user interaction. The key issue is segmentation, i.e., to separate the point cloud into smaller regions, where each can be approximated by a single surface. While this is relatively simple, where the regions are bounded by sharp edges, problems arise when smoothly connected regions need to be separated. The direct segmentation method described in this paper is based on a special sequence of tests, by means of which a large point cloud can be robustly splitted into smaller subregions until no further subdivision is possible. Surfaces of linear extrusion and revolution are also detected. The structure of the smooth, multiple regions is the basis of constrained surface fitting in the final model building phase.",

Generally, the concept anthropomorphism is used to describe this process. Anthropomorphism is defined in different ways, with much focus on either typical human attributes or uniquely human attributes. This difference has caused different measurement tools to be developed. We argue that anthropomorphism can best be described as a continuum ranging from low to high human likeness, and should be measured accordingly. We found that anthropomorphic characteristics can be invariantly ordered according to the ease with which these can be ascribed to robots.",

Such a network enables the user to request past, present and future data from the network in the form of historical, one-time and persistent queries respectively.

        "Title": "Motion parameter estimation of multiple ground moving targets in multi-static passive radar systems",
        "Abstract": "Multi-static passive radar (MPR) systems typically use narrowband signals and operate under weak signal conditions, making them difficult to reliably estimate motion parameters of ground moving targets. On the other hand, the availability of multiple spatially separated illuminators of opportunity provides a means to achieve multi-static diversity and overall signal enhancement. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating motion parameters, including velocity and acceleration, of multiple closely located ground moving targets in a typical MPR platform with focus on weak signal conditions, where traditional time-frequency analysis-based methods become unreliable or infeasible. The underlying problem is reformulated as a sparse signal reconstruction problem in a discretized parameter search space. While the different bistatic links have distinct Doppler signatures, they share the same set of motion parameters of the ground moving targets. Therefore, such motion parameters act as a common sparse support to enable the exploitation of group sparsity-based methods for robust motion parameter estimation. This provides a means of combining signal energy from all available illuminators of opportunity and, thereby, obtaining a reliable estimation even when each individual signal is weak. Because the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of motion parameters involves a multi-dimensional search and its performance is sensitive to target position errors, we also propose a technique that decouples the target motion parameters, yielding a two-step process that sequentially estimates the acceleration and velocity vectors with a reduced dimensionality of the parameter search space. We compare the performance of the sequential method against the ML estimation with the consideration of imperfect knowledge of the initial target positions. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the underlying parameter estimation problem is derived for a general multiple-target scenario in an MPR system. Simulation results are provided to compare the performance of the sparse signal reconstruction-based methods against the traditional time-frequency-based methods as well as the CRB.",

Experimental results are given on the large MCYT signature database (330 signers, 16500 signatures) for random and skilled forgeries. Feature selection experiments based on feature ranking are carried out. It is shown experimentally that the machine expert based on local information outperforms the system based on global analysis when enough training data is available. Conversely, it is found that global analysis is more appropriate in the case of small training set size. The two proposed systems are also shown to give complementary recognition information which is successfully exploited using decision-level score fusion.",

We use this model as a framework with which to investigate primary tumor invasion and treatment by surgical excision. We observe that the presence of immune cells can destroy tumors, hold them to minimal expansion, or, through the production of angiogenic factors, induce tumorigenic expansion. We also find that the tumor\u2013immune system dynamic is critically important in determining the likelihood and extent of tumor regrowth following resection. We find that small metastatic lesions distal to the primary tumor mass can be held to a minimal size via the immune interaction with the larger primary tumor. Numerical experiments further suggest that metastatic disease is optimally suppressed by immune activation when the primary tumor is moderately, rather than minimally, metastatic. Furthermore, satellite lesions can become aggressively tumorigenic upon removal of the primary tumor and its associated immune tissue. This can lead to recurrence where total cancer mass increases more quickly than in primary tumor invasion, representing a clinically more dangerous disease state. These results are in line with clinical case studies involving resection of a primary melanoma followed by recurrence in local metastases.",

We present ReIm, a type system for reference immutability, and ReImInfer, a corresponding type inference analysis. The type system is concise and context-sensitive. The type inference analysis is precise and scalable, and requires no manual annotations. In addition, we present a novel application of the reference immutability type system: method purity inference. To support our theoretical results, we implemented the type system and the type inference analysis for Java. We include a type checker to verify the correctness of the inference result.

Different from RFID, identification using infrared light has highly deterministic characteristics. IRID(infrared identification) is implemented with IR LEDs and photo transistors. By putting several infrared LEDs on the ceiling, the floor is divided into several sectors and each sector is set to have a unique identification. The coded infrared light tells which sector the robot is in, but the size of the uncertainty is still too large if the sector size is large, which usually occur. Dead-reckoning provides the estimated robot configuration but the error is getting accumulated as the robot travels. This paper presents an algorithm which fuses both the encoder and the IRID information so that the size of the uncertainty becomes smaller. It also introduces a framework which can be used with other types of the artificial landmarks. The characteristics of the developed IRID and the proposed algorithm are verified from the experiments.",

Dynamic software updating (DSU) addresses this problem by updating programs while they execute, but existing DSU systems for managed languages do not support many updates that occur in practice and are inefficient. This paper presents the design and implementation of J volve , a DSU-enhanced Java VM. Updated programs may add, delete, and replace fields and methods anywhere within the class hierarchy. Jvolve implements these updates by adding to and coordinating VM classloading, just-in-time compilation, scheduling, return barriers, on-stack replacement, and garbage collection. J volve , is safe : its use of bytecode verification and VM thread synchronization ensures that an update will always produce type-correct executions. Jvolve is flexible : it can support 20 of 22 updates to three open-source programs--Jetty web server, JavaEmailServer, and CrossFTP server--based on actual releases occurring over 1 to 2 years. Jvolve is efficient : performance experiments show that incurs no overhead during steady-state execution. These results demonstrate that this work is a significant step towards practical support for dynamic updates in virtual machines for managed languages.",

This type of adaptation does not require a software specialist and therefore it meets an important requirement of small-scale enterprises. Data transmission is done using the advantages of XML and Internet technology.",

        "Abstract": "Biometric identification systems are defined as systems exploiting automated methods of personal recognition based on physiological or behavioural characteristics. Among these, fingerprints are very reliable biometric identifiers. Trying to fasten the image processing step makes the recognition process more efficient, especially concerning embedded systems for real-time authentication. In this paper we propose an FPGA-based architecture that efficiently implements the high computationally demanding core of a matching algorithm based on phase-only spatial correlation. Moreover, we show how it is possible to use COTS components to embed an entire AFIS on chip and so reducing cost, space and energy used.",

        "Title": "Classification of breast masses in mammograms using neural networks with shape, edge sharpness, and texture features",
        "Abstract": "We propose an approach using artificial neural networks to classify masses in mammograms as malignant or benign. Single- layer and multilayer perceptron networks are used in a study on perceptron topologies and training procedures for pattern classifica- tion of breast masses. The contours of a set of 111 regions on mam- mograms related to breast masses and tumors are manually delin- eated and represented by polygonal models for shape analysis. Ribbons of pixels are extracted around the boundaries of a subset of 57 masses by dilating and eroding the contours. Three shape fac- tors, three measures of edge sharpness, and 14 texture features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrices of the pixels in the rib- bons are computed. Several combinations of the features are used with perceptrons of varying topology and training procedures for the classification of benign masses and malignant tumors. The results are compared in terms of the area Az under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Values of Az up to 0.99 are obtained with the shape factors and texture features. However, only feature sets that included at least one shape factor provide consistently high perfor- mance with respect to variations in network topology and training.",

        "Abstract": "With the increasingly diverse and complex requirements of radar systems and communication systems, the application of multifunction-phased array radar has become a trend, and the digital multi-beamforming technology plays a crucial role in it. In practice, power amplifier (PA) is an essential component in radar systems and communication systems. Unfortunately, it is always nonlinear to provide a high output power. With the purpose of a high output power and efficiency, it is necessary to study the influence of PA nonlinear characteristics on the digital multi-beamforming. In this paper, a form of the multi-beamforming signal and a nonlinear model with memory for PA are given. The output signal via the PA model has been analyzed subsequently. As the result of analysis, it can be found that the output signal is divided into the original signal and the interferential signal. The power ratio of original signal to interference signal can reflect the influence of PA nonlinear characteristics on the digital multi-beamforming. Finally, according to the ratio, the results of computer simulation show that the memory effect plays a key role for the small power signal, while the nonlinearity plays an important role for the large power signal.",

        "Title": "Relaxed multiple routing configurations for IP fast reroute",
        "Abstract": "Multi-topology routing is an increasingly popular IP network management concept that allows transport of different traffic types over disjoint network paths. The concept is of particular interest for implementation of IP fast reroute (IP FRR). First, it can support guaranteed, instantaneous recovery from any link or node failure. Second, different failures result in routing over different network topologies, which augments the parameter space for load distribution optimizations. Multiple routing configurations (MRC) is the state-of-the-art IP FRR scheme based on multi-topology routing today. In this paper we present a new, enhanced IP FRR scheme which we call ldquorelaxed MRCrdquo (rMRC). rMRC simplifies the topology construction and increases the routing flexibility in each topology. According to our experimental evaluation, rMRC has several benefits compared to MRC. The number of backup topologies required to provide protection against the same set of failures is reduced, hence reducing state in routers. In addition, the backup paths are shorter, and the link utilization is significantly better.",

        "Title": "Distributed approximation of capacitated dominating sets",
        "Abstract": "We study local, distributed algorithms for the capacitated minimum dominating set (CapMDS) problem, which arises in various distributed network applications. Given a network graph G = ( V,E ), and a capacity cap(v) \u2208 N for each node v \u2208 V , the CapMDS problem asks for a subset S \u2286 V of minimal cardinality, such that every network node not in S is covered by at least one neighbor in S , and every node v \u2208 S covers at most cap(v) of its neighbors. We prove that in general graphs and even with uniform capacities, the problem is inherently non-local , i.e., every distributed algorithm achieving a non-trivial approximation ratio must have a time complexity that essentially grows linearly with the network diameter. On the other hand, if for some parameter e > 0, capacities can be violated by a factor of 1 + e, CapMDS becomes much more local. Particularly, based on a novel distributed randomized rounding technique, we present a distributed bi-criteria algorithm that achieves an O(log \u0394)-approximation in time O(log 3 n + log( n )\/e), where n and \u0394 denote the number of nodes and the maximal degree in G , respectively. Finally, we prove that in geometric network graphs typically arising in wireless settings, the uniform problem can be approximated within a constant factor in logarithmic time, whereas the non-uniform problem remains entirely non-local.",

TimeML is the most recent annotation scheme for processing the event and temporal expressions in natural language processing fields. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate that unit feature dependency information and deep-level WordNet hypernyms are useful for event recognition and type classification. The proposed method utilizes various features including lexical semantic and dependency-based combined features. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, mainly due to the new strategies. Especially, the performance of noun and adjective events, which have been largely ignored and yet significant, is significantly improved.",

        "Abstract": "Deals with the use of multipass synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in order to achieve three-dimensional tomography reconstruction in presence of volumetric scattering. Starting from azimuth- and range-focused SAR data relative to the same area, neglecting any mutual interaction between the targets, and assuming the propagation in homogeneous media, we investigate the possibility to focus the data also in the elevation direction. The problem is formulated in the framework of linear inverse problem and the solution makes use of the singular value decomposition of the relevant operator. This allows us to properly take into account nonuniform orbit separation and to exploit a priori knowledge regarding the size of the volume interested by the scattering mechanism, thus leading to superresolution in the elevation direction. Results obtained on simulated data demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed processing technique.",

A simple and efficient method for obtaining filters modelling intermediate fractional delays from two Thiran fractional-delay filters is proposed.
