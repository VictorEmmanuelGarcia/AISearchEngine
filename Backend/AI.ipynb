Notwithstanding the successes and\\n future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\n the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\n perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\n in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\n currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\n developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\n To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\n principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\n practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\n guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\n Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\n and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\n further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\n developing, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\n trustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.',\n",

      "Title: Acquiring a Holistic Picture: The 4Screens Web-Based Simulator Helping Students to Unify Behaviours of Electronic Systems\n",
      "Abstract: Engineering knowledge is complex. Therefore, discipline concepts cannot usually be introduced to students all at once. Normally, individual models and behaviours are taught in several courses, by different teaching staff and in separate years of study. This often results in inadequate comprehension of the disciplinepsilas ldquobig picturerdquo - that is, the interrelationship of various concepts, models and behaviours. Students studying electronic circuit design, for example, often overlook important aspects of linear circuit performance. Their knowledge of the effects of steady-state and transient responses requires improved unification. Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.\n",

The second considers how this understanding can inform computer information systems design and operation and characterizes good “limits-aware” computing research.\n",

      "Abstract: Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods that are worth optimizing: the \"hot\" methods. This paper shows that four commonly-used Java profilers ( xprof , hprof , jprofile, and yourkit ) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement. This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental requirement for sampling based profilers: to be correct, a sampling-based profilermust collect samples randomly. We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects samples randomly, does not suffer from the above problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that are important to optimize; i...\n",
