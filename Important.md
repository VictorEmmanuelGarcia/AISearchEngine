# IMPORTANT

## Install Required Packages

To set up your Django project with Django Rest Framework (DRF), you need to install the following Python packages:

1. **Django Rest Framework**:

   ```bash
   pip install djangorestframework
   ```

   Django Rest Framework is a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django.

2. **Markdown** (Optional, for Markdown support in the browsable API):

   ```bash
   pip install markdown
   ```

   This package provides support for rendering Markdown content in the browsable API.

3. **Django Filter** (Optional, for advanced filtering support):

   ```bash
   pip install django-filter
   ```

   Django Filter allows you to create complex lookups for your API views, enabling advanced filtering of querysets.

Ensure that you install these packages in your Python environment before setting up your Django project with DRF.
